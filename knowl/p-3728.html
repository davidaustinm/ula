<div class="para">In a sense that will be made precise later, having a set of eigenvectors of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> that forms a basis of <span class="process-math">\(\real^2\)</span> enables us to think of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as being equivalent to a diagonal matrix <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span>  Of course, as the other examples in the previous activity show, it may not always be possible to form a basis from the eigenvectors of a matrix.  For example, the only eigenvectors of the matrix <span class="process-math">\(\left[\begin{array}{rr} 2 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 2
\end{array}\right]\text{,}\)</span> which represents a shear, have the form <span class="process-math">\(\twovec{x}{0}\text{.}\)</span>  In this example, we are not able to create a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\real^2\)</span> consisting of eigenvectors of the matrix.  This is also true for the matrix <span class="process-math">\(\left[\begin{array}{rr}
0 \amp -1 \\
1 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]
\text{,}\)</span> which represents a <span class="process-math">\(90^\circ\)</span> rotation.</div>
