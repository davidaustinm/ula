<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:51.2820512820513%;"><div class="para">The board for this game consists of 100 squares arranged in a <span class="process-math">\(10\times10\)</span> grid and numbered 1 to 100.  There are pairs of squares joined by a ladder and pairs joined by a chute.  All players begin in square 1 and take turns rolling a die.  On their turn, a player will move ahead the number of squares indicated on the die.  If they arrive at a square at the bottom of a ladder, they move to the square at the top of the ladder.  If they arrive at a square at the top of a chute, they move down to the square at the bottom of the chute.  The winner is the first player to reach square 100.</div></div>

<div class="para">We begin by playing a simpler version of this game with only eight squares laid out in a row as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-chutes-plain.html" title="Figure 4.5.13">Figure 4.5.13</a> and containing neither chutes nor ladders.  Rather than a six-sided die, we will toss a coin and move ahead one or two squares depending on the result of the coin toss.  If we are on square 7, we move ahead to square 8 regardless of the coin flip, and if we are on square 8, we will stay there forever.</div>

</ol></div> <div class="para">One can analyze the full version of Chutes and Ladders having 100 squares in the same way.  Without any chutes or ladders, one finds that the average number of moves required to reach square 100 is 29.0.  Once we add the chutes and ladders back in, the average number of moves required to reach square 100 is 27.1.  This shows that the average number of moves does not change significantly when we add the chutes and ladders.  There is, however, much more variation in the possibilities because it is possible to reach square 100 much more quickly and much more slowly.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-stochastic.html#exercise-178" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
