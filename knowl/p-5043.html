<div class="para">The board for this game consists of 100 squares arranged in a <span class="process-math">\(10\times10\)</span> grid and numbered 1 to 100.  There are pairs of squares joined by a ladder and pairs joined by a chute.  All players begin in square 1 and take turns rolling a die.  On their turn, a player will move ahead the number of squares indicated on the die.  If they arrive at a square at the bottom of a ladder, they move to the square at the top of the ladder.  If they arrive at a square at the top of a chute, they move down to the square at the bottom of the chute.  The winner is the first player to reach square 100.</div>
