<div class="para">This book arises from my belief that linear algebra, as presented in a traditional undergraduate curriculum, has for too long lived in the shadow of calculus.  Many mathematics programs currently require their students to complete at least three semesters of calculus, but only one semester of linear algebra, which often has two semesters of calculus as a prerequisite.</div>
