<div class="para">I could not imagine a more supportive environment than the mathematics department at Grand Valley State University.  The influence of my colleagues and their deep commitment to student growth is embedded in every page of this book.  Conversations about the teaching of linear algebra with Paul Fishback have been especially helpful as has editorial feedback from Lauren Keough and Lora Bailey.  I am also grateful for a sabbatical leave in 2017 during which I began this project.</div>
