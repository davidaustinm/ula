<div class="para">Of course, this is a contrived example.  Typically, the presence of noise in a dataset means that we do not expect all the points to be wholly contained in a smaller dimensional subspace.  In fact, the 2-dimensional subspace <span class="process-math">\(W_2\)</span> retains <span class="process-math">\(92\%\)</span> of the variance.  Depending on the situation, we may want to write off the remaining <span class="process-math">\(8\%\)</span> of the variance as noise in exchange for the convenience of working with a smaller dimensional subspace.  As weâ€™ll see later, we will seek a balance using a number of principal components large enough to retain most of the variance but small enough to be easy to work with.</div>
