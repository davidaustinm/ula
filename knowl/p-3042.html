<div class="para">This section has explored how appropriate changes in bases help us reconstruct an image using only a fraction of its data. This is known as image compression.</div>

<li><div class="para">There are several ways of representing colors, all of which use vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\real^3\text{.}\)</span>  We explored the <span class="process-math">\(RGB\)</span> color model, which is appropriate in digital applications, and the <span class="process-math">\(YC_bC_r\)</span> model, in which the most important visual information is conveyed by the <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> component, known as luminance.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We also explored a change of basis called the Discrete Fourier Transform.  In the coordinate system that results, the first coefficient measures the average of the components of a vector.  Other coefficients measure variations in the components away from the average.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We put both of these ideas to use in demonstrating the JPEG compression algorithm.  An image is broken into <span class="process-math">\(8\times8\)</span> blocks, and the colors into luminance, blue chrominance, and red chrominance.  Applying the Discrete Fourier Transform allows us to reconstruct a good approximation of the image using only a fraction of the original data.</div></li>
