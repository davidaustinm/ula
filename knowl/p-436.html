<div class="para">This is a very rough measure of the effort required to find the reduced row echelon form;  a more careful accounting shows that the number of arithmetic operations is roughly <span class="process-math">\(\frac23
n^3\text{.}\)</span>  As we have seen, some matrices require more effort than others, but the upshot of this observation is that the effort is proportional to <span class="process-math">\(n^3\text{.}\)</span> We can think of this in the following way: If the size of the matrix grows by a factor of 10, then the effort required grows by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(10^3 = 1000\text{.}\)</span>
