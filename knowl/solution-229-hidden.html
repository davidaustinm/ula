<div class="para">Because the eigenvalues are <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1=0.7\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_2=1.6\text{,}\)</span> this dynamical system is again a saddle.

<div class="para">This example is similar to the previous one, but the coefficients are slightly different.  We see that the growth rate of both species is smaller.

<div class="para">We now have the eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1=0.9\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_2=0.7\text{,}\)</span> which means that this dynamical system is an attractor and that both species will become extinct.</div>
