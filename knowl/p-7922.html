<div class="para">As we said earlier, a singular value decomposition should be thought of a generalization of an orthogonal diagonalization. For instance, the Spectral Theorem tells us that a symmetric matrix can be written as <span class="process-math">\(QDQ^T\text{.}\)</span>  Many matrices, however, are not symmetric and so they are not orthogonally diagonalizable.  However, every matrix has a singular value decomposition <span class="process-math">\(U\Sigma V^T\text{.}\)</span>  The price of this generalization is that we usually have two sets of singular vectors that form the orthogonal matrices <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> whereas a symmetric matrix has a single set of eignevectors that form the orthogonal matrix <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>
