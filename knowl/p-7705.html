<div class="para">Letâ€™s just focus on the contribution from <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_1\text{.}\)</span>  We see that the ninth component of <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_1\text{,}\)</span> the one that describes Fresh Fruit, is about <span class="process-math">\(-0.63\text{.}\)</span>  This means that the ninth component of <span class="process-math">\(477\uvec_1\)</span> differs from the mean by about <span class="process-math">\(477(-0.63) = -300\)</span> grams per person per week.  So roughly speaking, people in Northern Ireland are eating about 300 fewer grams of Fresh Fruit than the average across the four nations.  This is borne out by looking at the original data, which show that the consumption of Fresh Fruit in Northern Ireland is significantly less than the other nations.  Examing the other components of <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_1\)</span> shows other ways in which Northern Ireland differs from the other three nations.</div>
