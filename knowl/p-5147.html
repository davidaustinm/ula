<div class="para">Our discussion so far has ignored one issue, however. Remember that we sometimes have to perform row interchange operations in addition to row replacement.  A typical row interchange is represented by multiplication by a matrix such as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
\end{array}\right]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which has the effect of interchanging the first and third rows. Notice that this matrix is not triangular so performing a row interchange will disrupt the structure of the <span class="process-math">\(LU\)</span> factorization we seek.  Without giving the details, we simply note that linear algebra software packages provide a matrix <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> that describes how the rows are permuted in the Gaussian elimination process.  In particular, we will write <span class="process-math">\(PA = LU\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is a permutation matrix, <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is lower triangular, and <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is upper triangular.</div>
