<div class="para">Page <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is assessed to have the highest quality because its PageRank <span class="process-math">\(x_1=\frac49\)</span> is the largest.  This makes sense as a reflection of the structure of this Internet.  Since Page <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> only links to Page <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and not Page <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> it is not as useful as Page <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>  Furthermore, Page <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> only has one incoming link so it is not viewed by Page <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> as being useful.</div>
