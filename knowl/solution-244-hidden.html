<li><div class="para">Because <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a positive matrix, the Perron-Frobenius theorem tells us that there is a unique steady-state vector to which any Markov chain will converge.  Because <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is not a positive matrix, the Perron-Frobenius theorem does not tell us anything, and, indeed, we see that there is not a unique steady-state vector and different Markov chains can converge to different vectors.</div></li>
