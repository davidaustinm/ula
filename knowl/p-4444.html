<div class="para">In this section, we will put these ideas to use as we explore discrete dynamical systems, first encountered in <a href="sec-linear-trans.html#subsec-dynamical-systems" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.5.3: Discrete Dynamical Systems">SubsectionÂ 2.5.3</a>.  Recall that we used a state vector <span class="process-math">\(\xvec\)</span> to characterize the state of some system, such as the distribution of delivery trucks between two locations, at a particular time.  A matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> described the transition of the state vector with <span class="process-math">\(A\xvec\)</span> characterizing the state of the system at a later time.  Since we would like to understand how the state vector evolves over time, we are interested in studying the sequence of vectors <span class="process-math">\(A^k\xvec\text{.}\)</span>
