<li><div class="para">The determinant must be zero.  This is because the matrix cannot be invertible since there is a row without a pivot.  Also, applying a cofactor expansion along that row will produce zero for the determinant.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The determinant is zero again.  If we multiply one of the rows by <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> and add it to the other row, we obtain a row whose entries are all zero.  This operation does not change the determinant, but we know that the determinant of the new matrix is zero by the previous part of this problem.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The determinant must be zero.  This is because the columns are not linearly independent, which means that the matrix cannot be invertible.  Hence, the determinant is zero.</div></li>
