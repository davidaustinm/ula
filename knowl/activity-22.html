<p>Suppose that we work for a company that produces baked goods, including cakes, donuts, and eclairs.  Our company operates two plants, Plant 1 and Plant 2.  In one hour of operation,</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Plant 1 produces 10 cakes, 50 donuts, and 30 eclairs.</p></li>
<li><p>Plant 2 produces 20 cakes, 30 donuts, and 30 eclairs.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If plant 1 operates for <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> hours and Plant 2 for <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> hours, how many cakes <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> does the company produce?  How many donuts <span class="process-math">\(D\text{?}\)</span>  How many eclairs <span class="process-math">\(E\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We define a matrix transformation <span class="process-math">\(T(\xvec) =
\threevec{C}{D}{E}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\threevec{C}{D}{E}\)</span> represents the number of baked goods produced when the plants are operated for times <span class="process-math">\(\xvec=\twovec{x_1}{x_2}\text{.}\)</span>  If <span class="process-math">\(T(\xvec) 
= A\xvec\text{,}\)</span> what are the dimensions of the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Find the vector <span class="process-math">\(T\left(\twovec{1}{0}\right)\)</span> and the vector <span class="process-math">\(T\left(\twovec{0}{1}\right)\)</span> and use your results to write the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If we operate Plant 1 for 40 hours and Plant 2 for 50 hours, how many baked goods have we produced?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose the marketing department says we need to produce 1500 cakes, 4700 donuts, and 3300 eclairs. Is it possible to meet this order?  If so, how long should the two plants operate?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Let's now consider the needed ingredients:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Each cake requires 4 units of flour and and 2 units of sugar.</p></li>
<li><p>Each donut requires 1 unit of flour and 1 unit of sugar.</p></li>
<li><p>Each eclair requires 1 units of flour and 2 units of sugar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we make <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> cakes, <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> donuts, and <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> eclairs.  How many units of flour <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> are required? How many units of sugar <span class="process-math">\(S\text{?}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>Write a matrix <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> that defines the matrix transformation <span class="process-math">\(R\left(\threevec{C}{D}{E}\right) =
\twovec{F}{S}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If Plant 1 operates for 30 hours and Plant 2 operates for 20 hours, how many units of flour and sugar are required?</p></li>
<li><p>We can consider the matrix transformation <span class="process-math">\(P(\xvec) = \twovec{F}{S}\)</span> that tells us how many units of flour and sugar are required when we operate the plants for <span class="process-math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> hours.  Find the matrix that defines the transformation <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
