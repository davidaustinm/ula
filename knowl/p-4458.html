<div class="para">We will begin with a dynamical system that illustrates how the ideas weâ€™ve been developing can help us understand the populations of two interacting species.  There are several possible ways in which two species may interact.  For example, wolves on Isle Royale in northern Michigan prey on moose so this interaction is often called a predator-prey relationship. Other interactions between species, such as bees and flowering plants, are mutually beneficial for both species.</div>
