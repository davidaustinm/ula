<div class="para">Neglecting this experience does not serve our students well. For instance, only about 15% of current mathematics majors will go on to attend graduate school.  The remainder are headed for careers that will ask them to use their mathematical training in business, industry, and government.  What do these careers look like?  Right now, data analytics and data mining, computer graphics, software development, finance, and operations research.  These careers depend much more on linear algebra than calculus.  In addition to helping students appreciate the profound changes that mathematics has brought to our society, more training in linear algebra will help our students participate in the inevitable developments yet to come.</div>
