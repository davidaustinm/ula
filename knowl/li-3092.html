<div class="para">This example is similar to the previous one, but the coefficients are slightly different.  We see that the growth rate of both species is smaller.  For instance, in the previous problem, we had <span class="process-math">\(R_{k+1}=0.7R_k+\ldots\)</span> while we now have <span class="process-math">\(R_{k+1}=0.5R_k+\ldots\text{.}\)</span>  This says that the reproduction rate of species <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> has decreased from <span class="process-math">\(0.7\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(0.5\text{.}\)</span>  In the same way, that of species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> has decreased from <span class="process-math">\(1.6\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1.1\text{.}\)</span>  Also, <span class="process-math">\(R_{k+1}=\ldots + 0.2S_k\)</span> so the presence of species <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is less beneficial to species <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">We now have the eigenvalues <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_1=0.9\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_2=0.7\text{,}\)</span> which means that this dynamical system is an attractor and that both species will become extinct.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-dynamical.html#li-3092" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
