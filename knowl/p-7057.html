<div class="para">Many of the ideas weâ€™ll encounter in this chapter, such as orthogonal diagonalizations, can be applied to the study of data.  In fact, it can be useful to understand these applications because they provide an important context in which mathematical ideas have a more concrete meaning and their motivation appears more clearly.  For that reason, we will now introduce the statistical concept of variance as a way to gain insight into the significance of orthogonal diagonalizations.</div>
