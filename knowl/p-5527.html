<div class="para">To see how this could be useful, suppose we have medical data describing a group of patients, some of whom have been diagnosed with a specific condition, such as diabetes.  Perhaps we have a record of age, weight, blood sugar, cholesterol, and other attributes for each patient.  It could be that the data points for the group diagnosed as having the condition form a cluster that is somewhat distinct from the rest of the data.  Suppose that we are able to identify that cluster and that we are then presented with a new patient that has not been tested for the condition.  If the attributes for that patient place them in that cluster, we might identify them as being at risk for the condition and prioritize them for appropriate screenings.</div>
