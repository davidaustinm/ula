<div class="para">The interactive diagram we used in the activity is meant to convey the fact that the eigenvectors of a matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are special vectors.  Most of the time, the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vvec\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A\vvec\)</span> appear visually unrelated.  For certain vectors, however, <span class="process-math">\(\vvec\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A\vvec\)</span> line up with one another. Something important is going on when that happens so we call attention to these vectors by calling them eigenvectors. For these vectors, the operation of multiplying by <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> reduces to the much simpler operation of scalar multiplying by <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\text{.}\)</span>  The reason eigenvectors are important is because it is extremely convenient to be able to replace matrix multiplication by scalar multiplication.</div>
