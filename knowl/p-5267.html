<div class="para">We have typically found eigenvalues of a square matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as the roots of the characteristic polynomial <span class="process-math">\(\det(A-\lambda I) = 0\)</span> and the associated eigenvectors as the null space <span class="process-math">\(\nul(A-\lambda I)\text{.}\)</span>  Unfortunately, this approach is not practical when we are working with large matrices. First, finding the charactertic polynomial of a large matrix requires considerable computation, as does finding the roots of that polynomial.  Second, finding the null space of a singular matrix is plagued by numerical problems, as we will see in the preview activity.</div>
