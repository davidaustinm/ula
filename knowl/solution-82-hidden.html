<li><div class="para">Yes.  If <span class="process-math">\(c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2 = \zerovec\)</span> and one of the weights is not zero, we can rearrange this expression to solve for one of the vectors as a scalar multiple of the other.  For instance, if <span class="process-math">\(2\vvec_1-3\vvec_2=\zerovec\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1 = \frac32\vvec_2\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Any subset of the vectors forms a linearly independent set. Because the original set is linearly independent, none of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others.  This is still true when we look at a smaller set of the vectors.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The set of vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n,\bvec\)</span> will also be linearly independent.  Since <span class="process-math">\(A\xvec=\bvec\)</span> is inconsistent, we know that <span class="process-math">\(\bvec\)</span> cannot be written as a linear combination of the other vectors.  We also know that each of the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_j\)</span> cannot be written as a linear combination of the others because <span class="process-math">\(\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n\)</span> is a linearly independent set.</div></li>
