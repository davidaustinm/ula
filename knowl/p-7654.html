<div class="para">In fact, these subspaces are the best possible.  We know that the first principal component <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_1\)</span> is the eigenvector of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> associated to the largest eigenvalue.  This means that the variance is as large as possible in the <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_1\)</span> direction.  In other words, projecting onto any other line will retain a smaller amount of variance.  Similarly, projecting onto any other 2-dimensional subspace besides <span class="process-math">\(W_2\)</span> will retain less variance than projecting onto <span class="process-math">\(W_2\text{.}\)</span>  The principal components have the wonderful ability to pick out the best possible subspaces to retain as much variance as possible.</div>
