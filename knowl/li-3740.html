<div class="para">Our first task is to assess the similarity between various Wikipedia articles by forming vectors from each of five articles.  In particular, one may download the text from a Wikipedia article, remove common words, such as “the” and “and”, count the number of times the remaining words appear in the article, and represent these counts in a vector.</div>
<div class="para">For example, evaluate the following cell that loads some special commands along with the vectors constructed from the Wikipedia articles on Veteran’s Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, the Golden Globe Awards, and the Super Bowl.  For each of the five articles, you will see a list of the number of times 10 words appear in these articles. For instance, the word “act” appears 3 times in the Veteran’s Day article and 0 times in the Labor Day article. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-152"><script type="text/x-sage">sage.repl.load.load("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidaustinm/ula_modules/master/dot_similarity.py", globals())
events.head(int(10))
</script></pre> For each of the five articles, we obtain 604-dimensional vectors, which are named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">veterans</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">memorial</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">labor</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">golden</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">super</code>.</div>
<div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Suppose that two articles have no words in common.  What is the value of the dot product between their corresponding vectors?  What does this say about the angle between these vectors?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose there are two articles on the same subject, yet one article is twice as long.  What approximate relationship would you expect to hold between the two vectors?  What does this say about the angle between them?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Use the Sage cell below to find the angle between the vector <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">veterans</code> and the other four vectors.  To express the angle in degrees, use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">degrees(x)</code> command, which gives the number of degrees in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x</code> radians. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-153"><script type="text/x-sage">
</script></pre>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Compare the four angles you have found and discuss what they mean about the similarity between the Veteran’s Day article and the other four.  How do your findings reflect the nature of these five events?</div></li>
