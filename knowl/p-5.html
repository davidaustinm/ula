<div class="para">Of course, linear algebra is based on a set of abstract principles.  However, these principles underlie an astonishingly wide range of technology that shapes our society in profound ways.  The interplay between these principles and their applications provides a unique opportunity for working with students.  First, the consideration of significant real-world problems grounds abstract mathematical thinking in a way that deepens students’ understanding. At the same time, the variety of ways in which these abstract principles may be applied clearly demonstrates for students the power of mathematical abstraction.  Linear algebra empowers students to experience what the physicist Eugene Wigner called “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences,” an aspect of mathematics that is both fundamental and mysterious.</div>
