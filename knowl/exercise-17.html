<div class="para">We began our explorations in <a href="sec-expect.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.1: What can we expect">Section 1.1</a> by noticing that the solution spaces of linear systems with more equations seem to be smaller.  Let’s reexamine this idea using what we know about pivot positions.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Remember that the solution space of a single linear equation in three variables is a plane.  Can two planes ever intersect in a single point?  What are the possible ways in which two planes can intersect?  How can our understanding of pivot positions help answer these questions?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Suppose that a consistent linear system has more variables than equations.  By considering the possible pivot positions, what can you say with certainty about the solution space?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If a linear system has many more equations than variables, why is it reasonable to expect the system to be inconsistent?</div></li>
