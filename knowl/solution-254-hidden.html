<li><div class="para">If both <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are stochastic, all the entries of both <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are nonnegative. Therefore, the entries of <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> are also nonnegative.  In addition, we have <span class="process-math">\(S(AB) = (SA)B = SB = S\text{,}\)</span> which shows that <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is stochastic.</div></li>

<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(\qvec\)</span> is a steady-state vector for <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> it will be a steady-state vector for <span class="process-math">\(A^2\)</span> as well because <span class="process-math">\(A^2\qvec = A\qvec=\qvec\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">However, it is possible that there are steady-state vectors of <span class="process-math">\(A^2\)</span> that are not steady-state vectors of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  If the eigenvalues of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_j\text{,}\)</span> remember that the eigenvalues of <span class="process-math">\(A^2\)</span> are <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_j^2\text{.}\)</span>  Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(A^2\)</span> can have more steady-state vectors if <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_j=-1\)</span> is an eigenvalue of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> which leads to <span class="process-math">\(\lambda_j^2=1\text{.}\)</span>  For instance, <span class="process-math">\(A=\mattwo0110\)</span> has a unique steady-state vector <span class="process-math">\(\twovec{\frac12}{\frac12}\)</span> whereas every probability vector <span class="process-math">\(\twovec{p}{1-p}\)</span> is a steady-state vector for <span class="process-math">\(A^2=\mattwo1001\text{.}\)</span>
