<div class="para">We now turn to an important problem that will appear in many forms in the rest of our explorations.  Suppose, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-3d-orthog-proj.html" title="Figure 6.3.9">FigureÂ 6.3.9</a>, that we have a subspace <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\)</span> and a vector <span class="process-math">\(\bvec\)</span> that is not in that subspace.  We would like to find the vector <span class="process-math">\(\bhat\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> that is closest to <span class="process-math">\(\bvec\text{,}\)</span> meaning the distance between <span class="process-math">\(\bhat\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\bvec\)</span> is as small as possible.</div>
