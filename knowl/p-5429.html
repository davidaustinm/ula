<div class="para">In this chapter, we will begin to think of vectors as geometric objects that have lengths and that form angles.  In some cases, this will simplify our search for solutions to a linear system. Perhaps more importantly, we will be able to measure the distance between vectors.  This means that if a system <span class="process-math">\(A\xvec=\bvec\)</span> is inconsistent, we can look for <span class="process-math">\(\xhat\text{,}\)</span> the vector for which <span class="process-math">\(A\xhat\)</span> is as close to <span class="process-math">\(\bvec\)</span> as possible.  This leads to the method of <em class="emphasis">least squares</em>, which underpins regression, a key tool in data science.</div>
