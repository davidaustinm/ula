<div class="para">In a previous math class, you have probably seen the fact that, if we are given two points in the plane, then there is a unique line passing through both of them.  In this problem, we will begin with the four points on the left below and ask to find a polynomial that passes through these four points as shown on the right. <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:2.5%;margin-right:2.5%;">
