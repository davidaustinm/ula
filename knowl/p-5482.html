<div class="para">Vectors are often used to represent how a quantity changes over time.  For instance, the vector <span class="process-math">\(\svec=\fourvec{78.3}{81.2}{82.1}{79.0}\)</span> might represent the value of a company’s stock on four consecutive days.  When interpreted in this way, we call the vector a <em class="emphasis">time series.</em> Evaluate the Sage cell below to see a representation of two time series <span class="process-math">\(\svec_1\text{,}\)</span> in blue, and <span class="process-math">\(\svec_2\text{,}\)</span> in orange, which we imagine represent the value of two stocks over a period of time.
