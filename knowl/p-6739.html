<div class="para">It’s certainly true that higher degree polynomials fit the data better, as seen by the increasing values of <span class="process-math">\(R^2\text{,}\)</span> but that’s not always a good thing. For instance, when <span class="process-math">\(k=11\text{,}\)</span> you may notice that the graph of the polynomial wiggles a little more than we would expect. In this case, the polynomial is trying too hard to fit the data, which usually contains some uncertainty, especially if it’s obtained from measurements.  The error built in to the data is called <em class="emphasis">noise,</em> and its presence means that we shouldn’t expect our polynomial to fit the data perfectly.  When we choose a polynomial whose degree is too high, we give the noise too much weight in the model, which leads to some undesirable behavior, like the wiggles in the graph.</div>
<div class="para">Fitting the data with a polynomial whose degree is too high is called <em class="emphasis">overfitting</em>, a phenomenon that can appear in many machine learning applications. Generally speaking, we would like to choose <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> large enough to capture the essential features of the data but not so large that we overfit and build the noise into the model.  There are ways to determine the optimal value of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> but we won’t pursue that here.</div>
