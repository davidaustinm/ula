<span class="process-math">\(A\vvec\)</span> is a 9-dimensional vector.  For each justice, it tells us the number of times that justice voted with the majority minus the number of times they voted in the minority.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Out of 188 cases, the fifth justice Sandra Day O’Connor voted with the majority 94 more times than with the minority.  Since a swing vote will often vote in the majority, this gives additional evidence that Sandra Day O’Connor is a swing vote.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The first five justices more often vote with the majority and the last four more often with the minority.  This means the court leans toward the first five justices, who are the more conservative ones.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The fourth justice Anthony Kennedy voted with the majority 84 times more than with the minority.  He is a potential swing vote.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The third singular vector <span class="process-math">\(\uvec_3\)</span> effectively records his vote and not the votes of the other justices.  This lends support to the claim that Anthony Kennedy is a second, somewhat less influential, swing vote.</div></li>
