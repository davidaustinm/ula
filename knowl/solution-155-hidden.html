<li><div class="para">The same reasoning tells us that this determinant is <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and, in fact, the determinant of a lower triangular matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The determinant of this matrix is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> because the parallelogram formed by the vector has no area.  This suggests that the determinant of a matrix whose columns are linearly dependent is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span>
