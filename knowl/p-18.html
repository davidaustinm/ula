<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">With these thoughts in mind, the aim of this book is to facilitate a fuller, richer experience of linear algebra for all students, which informs the following decisions.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">This book is written without the assumption that students have taken a calculus course.</em> In making this decision, I hope that students will gain a more authentic experience of mathematics through linear algebra at an earlier stage of their academic careers.</div>
<div class="para">Indeed, a common barrier to student success in calculus is its relatively high prerequisite tower culminating in a course often called “Precalculus”.  By contrast, linear algebra begins with much simpler assumptions about our students’ preparation: the expressions studied are linear so that may be manipulated using only the four basic arithmetic operations.</div>
<div class="para">The most common explanation I hear for requiring calculus as a prerequisite for linear algebra is that calculus develops in students a beneficial “mathematical maturity.”  Given persistent student struggles with calculus, however, it seems just as reasonable to develop students’ abilities to reason mathematically through linear algebra.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">The text includes a number of significant applications of important linear algebraic concepts,</em> such as computer animation, the JPEG compression algorithm, and Google’s PageRank algorithm.  In my experience, students find these applications more authentic and compelling than typical applications presented in a calculus class.  These applications also provide a strong justification for mathematical abstraction, which can seem unnecessary to beginning students, and demonstrate how mathematics is currently shaping our world.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Each section begins with a preview activity and includes a number of activities that can be used to facilitate active learning in a classroom.</em> By now, active learning’s effectiveness in helping students develop a deep understanding of important mathematical concepts is beyond dispute.  The activities here are designed to reinforce ideas already encountered, motivate the need for upcoming ideas, and help students recognize various manifestations of simple underlying themes.  As much as possible, students are asked to develop new ideas and take ownership of them.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">The activities emphasize a broad range of mathematical thinking.</em> Rather than providing the traditional cycle of Definition-Theorem-Proof, <em class="emphasis">Understanding Linear Algebra</em> aims to develop an appreciation of ideas as arising in response to a need that students perceive.  Working much as research mathematicians do, students are asked to consider examples that illustrate the importance of key concepts so that definitions arise as natural labels used to identify these concepts.  Again using examples as motivation, students are asked to reason mathematically and explain general phenomena they observe, which are then recorded as theorems and propositions.  It is not, however, the intention of this book to develop students’ formal proof-writing abilities.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">There are frequent embedded Sage cells that help develop students’ computational proficiency.</em>  The impact that linear algebra is having on our society is inextricably tied to the phenomenal increase in computing power witnessed in the last half-century.  Indeed, Carl Cowen, former president of the Mathematical Association of America, has said, “No serious application of linear algebra happens without a computer.” This means that an understanding of linear algebra is not complete without an understanding of how linear algebraic ideas are deployed in a computational environment.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">The text aims to leverage geometric intuition to enhance algebraic thinking.</em> In spite of the fact that it may be difficult to visualize phenomena in thousands of dimensions, many linear algebraic concepts may be effectively illustrated in two or three dimensions and the resulting intuition applied more generally.  Indeed, this useful interplay between geometry and algebra illustrates another mysterious mathematical connection between seemingly disparate areas.</div></li>
