<li><div class="para">Yes.  A matrix formed from <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> linearly independent vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\)</span> will have a pivot position in every column.  Since the matrix has the same number of rows and columns, there must also be a pivot position in every row.  This means that the vectors span <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\)</span> and therefore form a basis.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Yes.  An invertible matrix is row equivalent to the identity matrix, which means that the columns are linearly independent and span <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\text{.}\)</span>  This implies that the columns form a basis of <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Yes.  The matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is row equivalent to the identity matrix so <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> must be as well.  This means that the columns of <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> form a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\real^m\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Yes.  The span of the set of vectors is <span class="process-math">\(\real^{10}\text{,}\)</span> which says that the associated matrix is square and has a pivot position in every row. Therefore, it must have a pivot position in every column, which means that the set of vectors forms a basis for <span class="process-math">\(\real^{10}\text{.}\)</span>
