<div class="para">It is a remarkable fact that algebra, which is about symbolic equations and their solutions, and geometry are intimately connected.  For instance, the solution set of a linear equation in two unknowns, such as <span class="process-math">\(2x + y = 1\text{,}\)</span> can be represented graphically by a straight line.  The aim of this section is to further this connection by introducing vectors, which will help us to apply geometric intuition to our thinking about linear systems.</div>
