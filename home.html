	      <em> Understanding Linear Algebra </em> is a freely
	      available linear algebra textbook suitable for use in a
	      first undergraduate linear algebra course.  The text aims
	      to support readers as they develop their ability to reason
	      mathematically, their computational
	      fluency, and their understanding of the role that linear
	      algebra plays in shaping our society.  It is also
	      designed to support an active learning classroom
	      environment.

	    <p>
	      <em> Understanding Linear Algebra </em> can support a
	      two-course introductory sequence to linear algebra.
	      While it is not meant to serve as an introduction to
	      proofs, activities and exercises support students as
	      they develop their ability to reason mathematically and
	      communicate their understanding.  At my university,
	      our first two linear algebra courses do not require
	      calculus as a prerequisite, and we find that many
	      students thrive in it.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <em>Understanding Linear Algebra</em> is intended to
	      support active learning.  Each 
	      section begins with a preview activity for students to
	      complete before class and subsequently contains several
	      activities for students to complete in class, perhaps
	      working collaboratively in small groups.  A solutions
	      manual for the activities is available upon request.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Each section contains numerous exercises from routine
	      review to more in-depth, conceptual questions.
	      Solutions are also available upon request.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      The text contains numerous embedded
	      <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/" target=_blank>
		Sage
	      </a>
	      cells to facilitate linear algebraic computations.
	      Relevant Sage commands are introduced as needed and
	      summarized in an appendix.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Many applications are introduced and developed in depth to
	      build an appreciation of how linear algebra plays a
	      vital role in our society.  These applications include
	      topics such as 
	      computer animation, image compression, Google PageRank,
	      least squares, principal component analysis, and singular
	      value decompositions.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Interactive diagrams embedded in the text help students
	      develop an intuitive understanding of key linear algebra
	      concepts.

	<h3>
	  For instructors
	</h3>

	<p>
	  First, I hope <em>Understanding Linear Algebra</em> is a
	  valuable resource for you and your students in whatever way
	  you find most appropriate to use it.
	  I would <em>very much</em> like to hear from you at the
	  email address given below.  Since the book is freely
	  available, it's difficult to know how many people are using
	  it and what value they are finding in it.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The book is in use at over 30 institutions, from R1s to
	  community colleges and high schools.  There is a community
	  of instructors using <em>ULA</em>, and we share resources
	  such as online homework sets, syllabi, learning objectives,
	  and more.  There are also solution
	  manuals for both the activities and exercises available upon
	  request.
	  Please reach out to me to connect with this
	  community.
