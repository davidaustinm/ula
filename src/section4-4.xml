  <title> Dynamical systems </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> The last section demonstrated ways in which we may relate a
    matrix, and the effect that multiplication has on vectors, to a
    simpler form.  For instance, if there is a basis of <m>\real^n</m>
    consisting of eigenvectors of <m>A</m>, we saw that <m>A</m> is
    similar to a diagonal matrix <m>D</m>.  As a result, the effect of
    multiplying vectors by <m>A</m>, when expressed using the basis of
    eigenvectors, is the same as multiplying by <m>D</m>.
    </p>

    <p> In this section, we will put these ideas to use as we explore
    discrete dynamical systems, first encountered in <xref
    ref="subsec-dynamical-systems" />.  Recall that we used a state
    vector <m>\xvec</m> to characterize the state of some system
    at a particular time, such as
    the distribution of delivery trucks between two locations.
    A matrix <m>A</m> described the transition of
    the state vector with <m>A\xvec</m> characterizing the state of the
    system at a later time.  Since we would like to understand how the
    state vector evolves over time, we are interested in studying the
    sequence of vectors <m>A^k\xvec</m>. </p>

    <p> Our goal in this section is to describe the types of behaviors
    that dynamical systems exhibit and to develop a means of detecting
    these behaviors.</p>

  <subsection>
    <title> A first example </title>

    <p> We will begin with a dynamical system
    that illustrates how the ideas we've been developing can help us
    understand the populations of two interacting species.  There are
    several possible ways in which two species may interact.  For
    example, wolves on Isle Royale in northern Michigan prey on moose
    so this interaction is often called a predator-prey relationship.
    Other interactions between species, such as bees and flowering
    plants, are mutually beneficial for both species.
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
      <p> Suppose we have two species <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> that
      interact with each another and that we record the change in their
      populations from year to year.  When we begin our study, the
      populations, measured in thousands, are <m>R_0</m> and <m>S_0</m>;
      after <m>k</m> years, the populations are <m>R_k</m>
      and <m>S_k</m>. </p>

      <p> If we know the populations in one year, suppose that
      the populations in the following year
      are determined by the expressions
      <me>
	\begin{aligned}
	R_{k+1} \amp {}={} 0.9 R_k + 0.8 S_k \\
	S_{k+1} \amp {}={} 0.2 R_k + 0.9 S_k\text{.} \\
	\end{aligned}
      </me>
      This is an example of a mutually beneficial relationship between
      two species.  If species <m>S</m> is not present, then
      <m>R_{k+1} = 0.9R_k</m>, which means that the population of
      species <m>R</m> decreases every year.  However, species
      <m>R</m> benefits from the presence of species <m>S</m>, which
      helps <m>R</m> to grow by 80% of the population of species
      <m>S</m>.  In the same way, <m>S</m> benefits from the presence
      of <m>R</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
      We will record the populations in a vector
      <m>\xvec_k = \twovec{R_k}{S_k}</m> and note that
      <m>\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k</m> where
      <m>A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      0.9 \amp 0.8 \\
      0.2 \amp 0.9 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </m>.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> Verify that
	<me>
	  \vvec_1=\twovec{2}{1},\qquad
	  \vvec_2=\twovec{-2}{1}
	</me>
	are eigenvectors of <m>A</m> and find their respective
	eigenvalues. </p></li>

	<li><p> Suppose that initially <m>\xvec_0 = \twovec{2}{3}</m>.
	Write 
	<m>\xvec_0</m> as a linear combination of the eigenvectors
	<m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  </p></li>

	<li><p> Write the vectors <m>\xvec_1</m>, <m>\xvec_2</m>, and
	<m>\xvec_3</m> as linear combinations of the eigenvectors
	<m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  </p></li>

	<li><p> What happens to <m>\xvec_k</m> after a very long time?
	</p></li> 

	<li><p> When <m>k</m> becomes very large, what happens to the

	<li><p> After a very long time, by approximately what factor does
	the population of <m>R</m> grow every year?  By approximately
	what factor does the population of <m>S</m> grow every year?
	</p></li> 

	<li><p> If we begin instead with <m>\xvec_0 =
	\twovec{4}{4}</m>, what eventually happens to the ratio
	<m>R_k/S_k</m> as <m>k</m> becomes very large? </p></li>

      </ol></p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
	<p><ol marker="a.">
	  <li><p> We find that <m>A\vvec_1=\twovec{2.6}{1.3} =
	  1.3\vvec_1</m> and
	  <m>A\vvec_2=\twovec{-1}{0.5}=0.5\vvec_2</m>.  This shows
	  that <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> are eigenvectors with
	  associated eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=1.3</m> and
	  <m>\lambda_2=0.5</m>.  </p></li>

	  <li><p> Solving for the weights of the linear combination of
	  <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> that produces
	  <m>\xvec_0</m>, we find that
	  <m>\xvec_0=2\vvec_1+\vvec_2</m>. </p></li>

	  <li><p> Each time we multiply by <m>A</m>, the eigenvectors
	  are multiplied by their associated eigenvalues.  This gives
	  <me>
	    \begin{aligned}
	    \xvec_1 = A\xvec_0 \amp = 2(1.3)\vvec_1 + 0.5\vvec_2 \\
	    \xvec_2 = A\xvec_1 \amp = 2(1.3)^2\vvec_1 + 0.5^2\vvec_2 \\
	    \xvec_3 = A\xvec_2 \amp = 2(1.3)^3\vvec_1 +
	    0.5^3\vvec_2\text{.} \\
	    \end{aligned}
	  </me>
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> After a long time <m>0.5^k\approx 0</m> so we have
	  <m>\xvec_k \approx 2(1.3)^k\vvec_1</m>.</p></li>

	  <li><p> More generally, we have <m>\xvec_k=2(1.3)^k\vvec_1 +
	  0.5^k\vvec_2</m>.  As <m>k</m> grows large, <m>0.5^k</m>
	  becomes insignificantly small so that <m>\xvec_k\approx
	  2(1.3)^k\vvec_1</m>.  This means that <m>R_k\approx
	  4(1.3)^k</m> and <m>S_k\approx2(1.3)^k</m> so that the ratio
	  <m>R_k/S_k \approx 2</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> We see that <m>\xvec_{k+1}\approx 1.3\xvec_k</m> so
	  that the populations both grow by a factor of approximately
	  1.3, which is a 30% growth rate. </p></li>

	  <li><p> Now we have <m>\xvec_0 = 3\vvec_1 + \vvec_2</m>.  In
	  the same way, when <m>k </m> is very large, we have
	  <m>\xvec_k\approx 3(1.3)^k\vvec_1</m> so that
	  <m>R_k\approx6(1.3)^k</m> and <m>S_k\approx3(1.3)^k</m>.
	  This gives the same ratio:  <m>R_k/S_k\approx
	  2</m>.</p></li>

	</ol></p>
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p> This activity demonstrates the type of systems we will be
    considering.  In particular, we will have vectors
    <m>\xvec_k</m> that describe the state of the system at time 
    <m>k</m> and a matrix <m>A</m> that describes how the state
    evolves from one time to the next: <m>\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k</m>.
    The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of <m>A</m> provide the key that
    helps us understand how the vectors <m>\xvec_k</m> evolve and that
    enables us to make long-range predictions.
    </p>

    <p> Let's look at the specific example in the previous activity
    more carefully.  We see that 
    <me>
      \xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k = 
      \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      0.9 \amp 0.8 \\
      0.2 \amp 0.9 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      \xvec_k
    </me>
    and that the matrix <m>A</m> has eigenvectors <m>\vvec_1 =
    \twovec{2}{1}</m> and <m>\vvec_2=\twovec{-2}{1}</m> with associated
    eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=1.3</m> and <m>\lambda_2=0.5</m>. </p>

    <p>
      With initial populations <m>\xvec_0=\twovec{2}{3}</m>, we have
      <me>
	\begin{aligned}
	\xvec_0 \amp {}={} 2\vvec_1 + 1\vvec_2 \\
	\xvec_1 \amp {}={} 1.3\cdot2\vvec_1 + 0.5\cdot1\vvec_2 \\
	\xvec_2 \amp {}={} 1.3^2\cdot2\vvec_1 + 0.5^2\cdot1\vvec_2 \\
	\xvec_k \amp {}={} 1.3^k\cdot2\vvec_1 + 0.5^k\cdot1\vvec_2. \\
	\end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's shift our perspective slightly.  The eigenvectors
      <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> form a basis <m>\bcal</m> of
      <m>\real^2</m>, which says that <m>A</m> is diagonalizable;
      that is, <m>A = PDP^{-1}</m> where
      <me>
	P = \left[\begin{array}{rr} \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2
	\end{array}\right] =
	\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	2 \amp -2 \\
	1 \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}\right], \qquad
	D = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	1.3 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0.5 \\
	\end{array}\right].
      </me>
    </p>

    <p> The coordinate system defined by the basis <m>\bcal</m> can be
    used to express the state vectors.  For instance,
    we can write the initial state vector
    <m>\xvec_0=\twovec{2}{3}= 2\vvec_1+\vvec_2</m>, which means that
    <m>\coords{\xvec_0}{\bcal} = \twovec{2}{1}</m>.  Moreover,
    <m>\xvec_1=A\xvec_0 = (1.3)\cdot2\vvec_1 + (0.5)\cdot1\vvec_2</m>
    so that
    <me>
      \coords{\xvec_1}{\bcal} = \twovec{1.3\cdot 2}{0.5\cdot 1} =
      D\twovec21 = D\coords{\xvec_0}{\bcal}.
    </me>  

    In the same way,
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      \coords{\xvec_1}{\bcal} \amp {}={} D\coords{\xvec_0}{\bcal} =
      \ctwovec{1.3\cdot 2}{0.5\cdot 1} \\
      \coords{\xvec_2}{\bcal} \amp {}={} D\coords{\xvec_1}{\bcal} =
      \ctwovec{1.3^2\cdot 2}{0.5^2\cdot1} \\
      \coords{\xvec_3}{\bcal} \amp {}={} D\coords{\xvec_2}{\bcal} =
      \ctwovec{1.3^3\cdot2}{0.5^3\cdot1} \\
      \coords{\xvec_k}{\bcal} \amp {}={} 
      \ctwovec{1.3^k\cdot2}{0.5^k\cdot1}\text{.} \\
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    </p>
    <p>
    More generally, we have
    <me>
      \coords{A\xvec}{\bcal} = D\coords{\xvec}{\bcal},
    </me>
    which is a restatement of the fact that <m>A</m> is
    similar to <m>D</m>.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="55% 45%">
      <p> Thinking about this geometrically, we begin with the vector
      <m>\coords{\xvec_0}{\bcal}=\ctwovec{2}{1}</m>.  Subsequent
      vectors <m>\coords{\xvec_k}{\bcal}</m> are obtained by scaling
      horizontally by a factor of <m>1.3</m> and scaling vertically by
      a factor <m>0.5</m>.  Notice how the points move along a curve
      away from the origin becoming ever closer to the horizontal
      axis. After a very long time, <m>\coords{\xvec_k}{\bcal} \approx
      \ctwovec{1.3^k\cdot2}{0}</m>.</p>

      <image source="images/eigen-dynamical-intro" />
    </sidebyside>

    <sidebyside widths="55% 45%">
      <p> To recover the behavior of the sequence <m>\xvec_0, \xvec_1,
      \xvec_2, \ldots</m>, we change coordinate systems using the
      basis defined by <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  Here, the
      points move along a curve away from the origin becoming ever
      closer to the line defined by <m>\vvec_1</m>.
      </p>

      <image source="images/eigen-dynamical-intro-1" />
    </sidebyside>

    <p> Eventually, the vectors become practically indistinguishable
    from a scalar multiple of <m>\vvec_1 = \twovec{2}{1}</m> since
    <m>\xvec_k\approx 1.3^k\cdot2\vvec_1</m>.  This means that
    <me>
      \xvec_k = \twovec{R_k}{S_k} \approx 1.3^k\cdot 2\vvec_1 = 
      \twovec{1.3^k\cdot4}{1.3^k\cdot2}.
    </me>
    This shows that
    <me>
      R_k/S_k \approx (1.3^k\cdot 4) / (1.3^k\cdot 2) = 2
    </me>
    so that we expect the population of species <m>R</m> to eventually
    be about
    twice that of species <m>S</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition, <m>\xvec_{k+1}
    \approx 1.3\xvec_k</m> so that <m>R_{k+1}\approx 1.3 R_k</m> and
    <m>S_{k+1}\approx 1.3 S_k</m>, which tells us that both
    populations are
    multiplied by 1.3 every year meaning the annual growth rate for
    both populations is about 30%.</p>

    <p> In the same way, we can consider other possible initial
    populations <m>\xvec_0</m> as shown in <xref
    ref="fig-eigen-dynam-saddle" />.  Regardless of <m>\xvec_0</m>, the
    population vectors, in the coordinates defined by <m>\bcal</m>, are
    scaled horizontally by a factor of <m>1.3</m> and vertically by a
    factor of <m>0.5</m>.  The sequence of points
    <m>\coords{\xvec_k}{\bcal}</m>, called <em>trajectories</em>, move
    along the curves, as shown on the left.  In the standard 
    coordinate system, we see that the trajectories
    converge to the eigenspace <m>E_{1.3}</m>. 
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-eigen-dynam-saddle">
      <sidebyside width="90%">
	<image source="images/eigen-dynam-saddle" />
      </sidebyside>
      <caption> The trajectories of the dynamical system formed by the
      matrix <m>A</m> in the coordinate system defined by
      <m>\bcal</m>, on the left,
      and in the standard coordinate system, on the right.</caption>
    </figure>

    <p> We conclude that, regardless of the initial populations, the
    ratio of the populations <m>R_k/S_k</m> will approach 2 to 1 and
    that the growth rate for both populations approaches 30%.  This
    example demonstrates the power of using eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors to rewrite the problem in terms of a new coordinate
    system.  By doing so, we are able to predict the long-term
    behavior of the populations independently of the initial
    populations. </p>

    <p> Diagrams like those shown in
    <xref ref="fig-eigen-dynam-saddle" /> are called <em>phase
    portraits.</em> 
    On the left of <xref ref="fig-eigen-dynam-saddle" /> is the phase
    portrait of the diagonal matrix <m>D=\mattwo{1.3}00{0.5}</m> while
    the right of that figure shows the phase portrait of <m>A =
    \mattwo{0.9}{0.8}{0.2}{0.9}</m>.  The phase portrait of <m>D</m>
    is relatively easy to understand because it is determined only by
    the two eigenvalues.  Once we have the
    phase portrait of <m>D</m>, however, the phase portrait of
    <m>A</m> has a similar appearance with the eigenvectors
    <m>\vvec_j</m> replacing the standard basis vectors
    <m>\evec_j</m>. </p>

  </subsection>
  
  <subsection>
    <title> Classifying dynamical systems </title>

    <p> In the previous example, we were able to make predictions
    about the behavior of trajectories <m>\xvec_k=A^k\xvec_0</m>
    by considering the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix
    <m>A</m>.  The next activity looks at a collection of matrices
    that demonstrate the types of behavior a <m>2\times2</m> dynamical
    system can exhibit. </p> 

    <activity>
      <statement>
      <p> We will now look at several more examples of dynamical
      systems.  If
      <m>P = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      1 \amp -1 \\
      1 \amp 1 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </m>, we note
      that the columns of <m>P</m> form a basis
      <m>\bcal</m> of <m>\real^2</m>.  Given below are several
      matrices <m>A</m> written in the form <m>A=PEP^{-1}</m> for some
      matrix <m>E</m>.  For each matrix, state the eigenvalues of
      <m>A</m> and sketch a phase portrait for the matrix <m>E</m> on
      the left and a phase portrait for <m>A</m> on the right.
      Describe the behavior of <m>A^k\xvec_0</m> as
      <m>k</m> becomes very large for a typical initial vector
      <m>\xvec_0</m>.

      This list includes many types of expected behavior, but there

    <activity>
      <statement>
      <p> In this activity, we will consider several ways in which two
      species might interact with one another.  Throughout, we will
      consider two species <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> whose populations in
      year <m>k</m> form a vector <m>\xvec_k=\twovec{R_k}{S_k}</m> and
      which evolve according to the rule
      <me>
	\xvec_{k+1}=A\xvec_k
      </me>.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li>
	  <p> Suppose that
	  <m> A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  0.7 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 1.6 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  </m>.
	  </p>

	  <p> Explain why the species do not interact with one

	  -0.4 \amp 1.1 \\

	  Compare this predator-prey system to the one in the

      </ol>
      </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
	<p><ol marker="a.">
	  <li><p> With this matrix <m>A</m>, we have
	  <me>
	    \begin{aligned}
	    R_{k+1} \amp = 0.7R_k \\
	    S_{k+1} \amp = 1.6S_k\text{.} \\
	    \end{aligned}
	  </me>
	  This shows that the population of one species does not
	  depend on the other.  This dynamical system is a saddle
	  because we have the eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=0.7</m> and
	  <m>\lambda_2=1.6</m>.  Eventually, species <m>R</m> will
	  become extinct while species <m>S</m> grows by a factor of
	  1.6.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> Now we have
	  <me>
	    \begin{alignedat}{3}
	    R_{k+1} \amp {}={} \amp 0.7R_k \amp{}+{} \amp 0.3S_k\\
	    S_{k+1} \amp {}={} \amp \amp \amp 1.6S_k\text{.} \\
	    \end{alignedat}
	  </me>
	  The population of species <m>S</m> is not influenced by
	  species <m>R</m>.  However, we see that the population of
	  species <m>R</m> grows in the presence of species <m>S</m>.
	  In other words, species <m>S</m> helps species <m>R</m> to
	  grow so we say that <m>S</m> is beneficial for <m>R</m>.
	</p>

	<p> Because the eigenvalues are <m>\lambda_1=0.7</m> and
	<m>\lambda_2=1.6</m>, this dynamical system is again a
	saddle.  The associated eigenvectors are
	<m>\vvec_1=\twovec10</m> and <m>\vvec_2=\twovec13</m>.  After
	a long time, the population vector <m>\xvec_k\approx
	c_1(1.6)^k\vvec_2</m> so both populations grow by a factor of
	1.6 and with a ratio <m>R_k/S_k=1/3.</m>
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> Here we have 
	  <me>
	    \begin{alignedat}{3}
	    R_{k+1} \amp {}={} \amp 0.7R_k \amp{}+{} \amp 0.5S_k\\
	    S_{k+1} \amp {}={} \amp -0.4R_k \amp {}+{}\amp 1.6S_k\text{.} \\
	    \end{alignedat}
	  </me>
	  Species <m>S</m> helps species <m>R</m> to grow, while
	  species <m>R</m> inhibits the growth of species <m>S</m>.
	  One explanation for this is that species <m>R</m> preys on
	  species <m>S</m> as a food source.
	</p>

	<p> We have eigenvectors <m>\vvec_1=\twovec11</m> with
	associated eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1=1.2</m> and
	<m>\vvec_2=\twovec{5}{4}</m> with <m>\lambda_2=1.1</m>.  This
	dynamical system is a repellor so both species will grow
	arbitrarily large.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> This example is similar to the previous one, but the
	  coefficients are slightly different.  We see that the growth
	  rate of both species is smaller.  For instance, in the
	  previous problem, we had <m>R_{k+1}=0.7R_k+\ldots</m> while
	  we now have <m>R_{k+1}=0.5R_k+\ldots</m>.  This says that
	  the reproduction rate of species <m>R</m> has decreased
	  from <m>0.7</m> to <m>0.5</m>.  In the same way, that of
	  species <m>S</m> has decreased from <m>1.6</m> to
	  <m>1.1</m>.  Also, <m>R_{k+1}=\ldots + 0.2S_k</m> so the
	  presence of species <m>S</m> is less beneficial to species
	  <m>R</m>.  </p>

	  <p> We now have the eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=0.9</m> and
	  <m>\lambda_2=0.7</m>, which means that this dynamical system is
	  an attractor and that both species will become
	  extinct. </p></li>

    <title> A <m>3\times3</m> system </title>

    <p> Up to this point, we have focused on <m>2\times2</m> systems.
    In fact, the general case is quite similar.  As an example,
    consider a <m>3\times3</m> system <m>\xvec_{k+1}=A\xvec_k</m>
    where the matrix <m>A</m> has eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1 = 0.6</m>,
    <m>\lambda_2 = 0.8</m>, and <m>\lambda_3=1.1</m>.  Since the
    eigenvalues are real and distinct, there is a
    basis <m>\bcal</m> consisting of
    eigenvectors of <m>A</m> so we can look at the trajectories
    <m>\coords{\xvec_k}{\bcal}</m> in the coordinate system defined by
    <m>\bcal</m>.  The phase portraits in <xref
    ref="fig-eigen-3d-saddle" /> show how some representative
    trajectories will evolve.  We see that all the trajectories will
    converge into the eigenspace <m>E_{1.1}</m>.

    <p> In the same way, suppose we have a <m>3\times3</m> system with
    complex eigenvalues <m>\lambda=0.8 \pm 0.5i</m> and
    <m>\lambda_3=1.1</m>.  Since the complex eigenvalues satisfy
    <m>|\lambda| \lt 1</m>, there is a two-dimensional subspace in which
    the trajectories spiral in toward the origin.  The phase portraits
    in <xref ref="fig-eigen-3d-spiral" /> show some of the
    trajectories.  Once 
    again, we see that all the trajectories converge into the
    eigenspace <m>E_{1.1}</m>. </p>

	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0.4 \\
	  0.8 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0.9 \amp 0.8 \\
	  \end{array}\right]</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> There is a real eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1=1.058</m>,
	  which is larger than <m>1</m>.  The other eigenvalues are
	  complex <m>\lambda_{2,3} = -0.128\pm 0.506i</m> and satisfy
	  <m>|\lambda_{2,3}| \lt 1</m>.  Therefore, the complex
	  eigenvalues will pull vectors in toward the line defined by
	  the eigenvector <m>\vvec_1</m>.  After a long
	  time, the population is <m>\xvec_k\approx
	  c_1(1.058)^k\vvec_1</m>.  All the populations grow annually
	  by a factor of <m>1.058</m> or 5.8%, and there are
	  approximately 38 juveniles and 29 yearlings for every 100
	  adults. </p></li>

	  <li><p> We now have eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=1.011</m> and
	  <m>\lambda_{2,3} = -0.106\pm 0.450i</m>.  This shows that
	  the growth rate is lowered to <m>1.011</m> or
	  <m>1.1</m>% annually.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The first eigenvalue is <m>\lambda_1=0.957</m> so
	  the growth rate is about <m>96</m>%.  In other
	  words, the population decreases every year.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> To be stable, we need the first eigenvalue
	  <m>\lambda_1=1</m>.  If we experiment with different birth
	  rates,
	  we see that a birth rate of about 0.278 gives this
	  eigenvalue. </p></li>

    <title> Summary </title>

    <p> We have been exploring discrete dynamical systems in which an
    initial state vector <m>\xvec_0</m> evolves over time according
    to the rule <m>\xvec_{k+1}=A\xvec_k</m>.  The
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors of <m>A</m> help us understand the
    behavior of the state vectors.  In the <m>2\times2</m>
    case, we saw that
    <ul>
      <li><p> <m>|\lambda_1|, |\lambda_2| \lt 1</m> produces an
      attractor so that trajectories are pulled in toward the
      origin. </p></li>

      <li><p> <m>|\lambda_1| \gt 1</m> and <m>|\lambda_2| \lt 1</m>
      produces a saddle in which most trajectories are pushed away
      from the origin and in the direction of
      <m>E_{\lambda_1}</m>. </p></li>

      <li><p> <m>|\lambda_1|, |\lambda_2| \gt 1</m> produces a
      repellor in which trajectories are pushed away from the
      origin. </p></li>
    </ul>
    The same kind of reasoning allows us to analyze <m>n\times n</m>
    systems as well.</p>
