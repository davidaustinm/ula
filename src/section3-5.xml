  <title> Subspaces </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In this chapter, we have been looking at bases for
    <m>\real^p</m>, sets of vectors that are linearly independent and
    span <m>\real^p</m>.  Frequently, however, we focus on only a
    subset of <m>\real^p</m>.  In particular, if we are given an
    <m>m\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, we have been interested in both
    the span of the columns of <m>A</m> and the solution space to the
    homogeneous equation <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m>.  In this section,
    we will expand the concept of basis to describe sets like these.
    </p>
    
    <exploration label="ula-preview-3-5">
      <introduction>
        <p> Let's consider the following matrix <m>A</m> and its reduced
        row echelon form.
        <me>
	  A = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	  2 \amp -1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\

        <response component="rs-preview"/>
        <solution>
	  <p> The columns of <m>A</m> are not linearly independent

  <subsection>
    <title> Subspaces </title>

    <p>
      Our goal is to develop a common framework for describing subsets
      like the span of the columns of a matrix and the solution space
      to a homogeneous equation.  That leads us to the following
      definition. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <idx> subspace </idx>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  A <term>subspace</term> of <m>\real^p</m> is a subset of
	  <m>\real^p</m> that is the span of a set of vectors.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Since we have explored the concept of span in some detail, this
      definition just gives us a new word to describe something
      familiar.  Let's look at some examples.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title> Subspaces of <m>\real^3</m> </title>

      <p>
	In <xref ref="activity-span-r3"/> and the following
	discussion, we looked at subspaces in <m>\real^3</m> without
	explicitly using that language.  Let's recall some of those
	examples.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <sidebyside widths="45% 50%">
		<p>
		  Suppose we have a single nonzero vector
		  <m>\vvec</m>.  The span of <m>\vvec</m> is a
		  subspace, which we'll write as <m>S =
		  \laspan{\vvec}</m>.  As we have seen, the span of a
		  single vector consists of all scalar multiples
		  of that vector, and these form a line passing
		  through the origin.

                    <m>\vvec</m>.</p>

		If instead we have two linearly independent vectors

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Consider the three vectors <m>\evec_1</m>,
	      <m>\evec_2</m>, and <m>\evec_3</m>. Since we know that
	      every 3-dimensional vector can be written as a linear
	      combination, we have <m>S = \laspan{\evec_1, \evec_2,
	      \evec_3} = \real^3</m>.

	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      One more subspace worth mentioning is
	      <m>S=\laspan{\zerovec}</m>.  Since any linear
	      combination of the zero vector is itself the zero
	      vector, this subspace consists of a single vector,
	      <m>\zerovec</m>. 
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p>
	In fact, any subspace of <m>\real^3</m> is one of these types:
	the origin, a line, a plane, or all of <m>\real^3</m>.
      </p>

      As the activity shows, it is possible to represent some
      subspaces as the span of more than one set of vectors.  We are
      particularly interested in representing a subspace as the span
      of a linearly independent set of vectors.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
	<idx> dimension </idx>
	<p> A <em>basis</em> for a subspace <m>S</m> of <m>\real^p</m>
	is a set of vectors in <m>S</m> that are linearly independent
	and whose span is <m>S</m>.  We say that the
	<em>dimension</em> of the subspace <m>S</m>, denoted <m>\dim
	S</m>, is the number of vectors in any basis.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <example>
      <title> A subspace of <m>\real^4</m> </title>

      <p>
	Suppose we have the 4-dimensional vectors <m>\vvec_1</m>,
	<m>\vvec_2</m>, and <m>\vvec_3</m> that define the subspace
	<m>S = \laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_3}</m> of
	<m>\real^4</m>.  Suppose also that
	<me>
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \vvec_3
	  \end{bmatrix}
	  \sim
	  \begin{bmatrix}

	From the reduced row echelon form of the matrix, we see that
	<m>\vvec_2 = -\vvec</m>.  Therefore, any linear combination
	of <m>\vvec_1</m>, <m>\vvec_2</m>, and <m>\vvec_3</m> can be
	rewritten

	as a linear combination of <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_3</m>.
	This tells us that

	Furthermore, the reduced row echelon form of the matrix shows

	subspace of <m>\real^4</m>.

    <p>
      Subspaces of <m>\real^3</m> are either

	    0-dimensional, consisting of the single vector

	    the 3-dimensional subspace <m>\real^3</m>.
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
      There is no 4-dimensional subspace of

  <subsection>
    <title> The column space of <m>A</m> </title>

    <p>
      The first subspace associated to a matrix that we'll consider is
      its column space. 
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
	<idx> column space </idx>
	<p> If <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, we call the
	span of its columns the <em>column space</em> of <m>A</m> and
	denote it as <m>\col(A)</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Notice that the columns of <m>A</m> are vectors in
      <m>\real^m</m>, which means that any linear combination of the
      columns is also in <m>\real^m</m>.  Since the column space is
      described as the span of a set of vectors, we see that
      <m>\col(A)</m> is
      a subspace of <m>\real^m</m>.
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
      <p> We will explore some column spaces in this activity.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p>
	  Consider the matrix
	  <me>A= \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \vvec_3

	  =

	  -2 \amp 0 \amp -4 \\
	  1 \amp 2 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{array}\right].
	  </me>
	  Since <m>\col(A)</m> is the span of the columns,
	  we have
	  <me>
	    \col(A) = \laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_3}.
	  </me>
	  Explain why <m>\vvec_3</m> can be written as a linear
	  combination of <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> and
	  why <m>\col(A)=\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2}</m>.
	</p> </li>

	<li><p> Explain why the vectors <m>\vvec_1</m> and
	<m>\vvec_2</m> form a basis for <m>\col(A)</m> and why
	<m>\col(A)</m> is a 2-dimensional subspace of
	<m>\real^3</m> and therefore a plane. </p></li>

	<li><p> Now consider the matrix <m>B</m> and its reduced row
	echelon form:
	<me>
	  B = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	  -2 \amp -4 \amp 0 \amp 6 \\
	  1 \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \sim
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	  1 \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp -3 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{array}\right].
	</me>
	Explain why <m>\col(B)</m> is a 1-dimensional
	subspace of <m>\real^2</m> and is therefore a line.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> For a general matrix <m>A</m>, what is the
	relationship between the dimension 
	<m>\dim~\col(A)</m> and the number of pivot positions in
	<m>A</m>? </p></li>

	<li><p> How does the location of the pivot positions indicate
	a basis for <m>\col(A)</m>?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> If <m>A</m> is an invertible <m>9\times9</m> matrix,
	what can you say about the column space <m>\col(A)</m>?
	</p></li>

	<li>
	  <p> Suppose that <m>A</m> is an <m>8\times 10</m> matrix and

	  which shows that the vectors are not linearly
	  independent and, in fact, that <m>\vvec_3 = 2\vvec_1 -
	  \vvec_2</m>.  As we've seen several times, this means that
	  any linear combination of <m>\vvec_1</m>, <m>\vvec_2</m>, and
	  <m>\vvec_3</m> can be written as a linear combination of
	  <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> alone and hence that
	  <me>\col(A)=\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_3} =
	  \laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2}.</me>  
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m> shows that
	  <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> are linearly independent.
	  We also know that the span of these two vectors is
	  <m>\col(A)</m>.  Therefore, they form a basis for
	  <m>\col(A)</m>. </p></li>

	  <li><p> Denoting the columns of <m>B</m> as <m>\vvec_i</m>,
	  the reduced row echelon form shows that
	  <m>\vvec_2=2\vvec_1</m>, <m>\vvec_3=0\vvec_1</m>, and
	  <m>\vvec_4 = -3\vvec_1</m>.
	  Therefore, any linear combination of <m>\vvec_1</m>,
	  <m>\vvec_2</m>, <m>\vvec_3</m>, and <m>\vvec_4</m> can be
	  written as a linear combination of <m>\vvec_1</m>
	  alone.  This means that <m>\vvec_1</m> forms a basis for
	  <m>\col(A)</m>, which is then the line consisting of all
	  scalar multiples of <m>\vvec_1</m>.
p	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The number of vectors in a basis of <m>\col(A)</m>
	  equals the number of pivot positions.  Therefore,
	  <m>\dim~\col(A)</m> equals the number of pivot positions in
	  <m>A</m>. </p></li>

	  <li><p> As the examples in this activity illustrate, the
	  columns of <m>A</m> that contain pivot positions form a
	  basis for <m>\col(A)</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> If <m>A</m> is invertible, then it has a pivot
	  position in every row, which means that the span of the
	  columns is <m>\real^9</m>.  Therefore, <m>\col(A) =
	  \real^9</m>. </p></li>

	  <li><p> Since <m>\col(A)=\real^8</m>, we know that every
	  8-dimensional vector <m>\bvec</m> is in <m>\col(A)</m>.
	  This means that <m>\bvec</m> is in the span of the columns
	  of <m>A</m> so the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> must be
	  consistent. </p></li>

    <example xml:id="example-col-basis">
      <p>
	Consider the matrix <m>A</m> and its
	reduced row echelon form:
	<me>
	  A =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
	  2 \amp 0 \amp -4 \amp -6 \amp 0 \\
	  -4 \amp -1 \amp 7 \amp 11 \amp 2 \\
	  0 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\

	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{array}\right],
	  </me>
	  and denote the columns of <m>A</m> as
	  <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_5</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p> It is certainly true that <m>\col(A) =
      \laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_5}</m> by the definition of
      the column space.  However, the reduced row echelon form of the
      matrix shows us that the vectors are not linearly independent so
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_5</m> do not form a basis for
      <m>\col(A)</m>. 
      </p>
      
      <p> From the reduced row echelon form, however, we can see that
      <me>
	\begin{aligned}
	\vvec_3 \amp {}={} -2\vvec_1 + \vvec_2 \\
	\vvec_4 \amp {}={} -3\vvec_1 + \vvec_2 \\
	\vvec_5 \amp {}={} -2\vvec_2 \\
	\end{aligned}
	</me>.
	This means that any linear combination of
	<m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_5</m> can be written as a linear
	combination of just <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  Therefore,
	we see that <m>\col(A) = \laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2}</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Moreover,
	the reduced row echelon form shows that <m>\vvec_1</m> and
	<m>\vvec_2</m> are linearly independent, which implies that they
	form a basis for <m>\col(A)</m>.  This means that
	<m>\col(A)</m> is a 
	2-dimensional subspace of <m>\real^3</m>, which is a plane in
	<m>\real^3</m>, having basis
	<me>
	  \threevec{2}{-4}{0},
	  \qquad
	  \threevec{0}{-1}{1}
	  </me>.
      </p>
    </example>
      
    <p> In general, a column without a pivot position can be written
    as a linear combination of the columns that have pivot positions.
    This means that a basis for <m>\col(A)</m> will always be given by
    the columns of <m>A</m> having pivot positions.  This leads us to
    the following definition and proposition.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <idx> rank </idx>
      <idx> matrix, rank </idx>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The <term>rank</term> of a matrix <m>A</m> is the number of
	  pivot positions in <m>A</m> and is denoted by
	  <m>\rank(A)</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <proposition xml:id="proposition-col-dim">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  If <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, then
	  <m>\col(A)</m> is a subspace of <m>\real^m</m> whose
	  dimension equals <m>\rank(A)</m>.  The columns of <m>A</m>
	  that contain pivot positions form a basis for <m>\col(A)</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      For example, the rank of the matrix <m>A</m> in <xref
      ref="example-col-basis"/> is two because there are two pivot
      positions.  A basis for <m>\col(A)</m> is given by the first two
      columns of <m>A</m> since those columns have pivot positions.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a note of caution, we determine the pivot positions by
      looking at the reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>.  However,
      we form a basis of <m>\col(A)</m> from the columns of <m>A</m>
      rather than the columns of the reduced row echelon matrix.

    <title> The null space of <m>A</m> </title>

      The second subspace associated to a matrix is its null space.

	<idx> null space </idx>
	<p> If <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, we call the

    <p>
      Remember that a subspace is a subset that can be represented as
      the span of a set of vectors.  The column space of <m>A</m>,
      which is simply the span of the columns of <m>A</m>, fits this
      definition.  It may not be immediately clear how the null space of

      <p> This expression says that any vector <m>\xvec</m> satisfying
      <m>A\xvec= \zerovec</m> is a linear combination of the vectors
      <me>
	\vvec_1 = \fivevec{2}{-1}{1}{0}{0},~~~

      It is straightforward to check that these vectors are linearly
      independent, which means that <m>\vvec_1</m>, <m>\vvec_2</m>,
      and <m>\vvec_3</m> form a basis for <m>\nul(A)</m>, a
      3-dimensional subspace of <m>\real^5</m>.

    </example>

    <p>
      As illustrated in this example, the dimension of <m>\nul(A)</m>
      is equal to the 
      number of free variables in the equation
      <m>A\xvec=\zerovec</m>, which equals the number of columns of
      <m>A</m> without pivot positions or the
      number of columns of <m>A</m> minus the number of pivot positions.

    <xref ref="fundamental-questions" text="custom">
    our two fundamental questions
    </xref>
    concerning the existence and uniqueness of solutions to linear
    systems.  The column space <m>\col(A)</m> contains all the vectors
    <m>\bvec</m> for which the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is
    consistent. The null space <m>\nul(A)</m> is the solution
    space to the equation <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m>, which reflects on
    the uniqueness of solutions to this and other equations.

      <ul>
	<li><p> A subspace <m>S</m> of <m>\real^p</m> is a subset of
	<m>\real^p</m> that can be represented as the span of a set of
	vectors.  A basis of <m>S</m> is a linearly
	independent set of vectors whose span is
	<m>S</m>. </p></li>

	<li><p> If <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, the column
	space <m>\col(A)</m> is the span of the 
	columns of <m>A</m> and forms a subspace of <m>\real^m</m>.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> A basis for <m>\col(A)</m> is found from the columns
	of <m>A</m> that have pivot positions.  The dimension is
	therefore <m>\dim~\col(A) = \rank(A)</m>.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> The
	null space <m>\nul(A)</m> is the solution space to the
	homogeneous equation <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m> and is a
	subspace of <m>\real^n</m>.  </p></li>

	<li><p> A basis for <m>\nul(A)</m> is found through a
