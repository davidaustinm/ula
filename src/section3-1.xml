    Invertibility
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Up to this point, we have used the Gaussian elimination
    algorithm to find solutions to linear systems.  We now
    investigate another way to find solutions to the 
    equation <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> when the matrix <m>A</m> has the same
    number of rows and columns.  To get started, let's look at some
    familiar examples.

    <p> The preview activity began with a familiar type of 
    equation, <m>3x = 5</m>, and asked for a strategy to solve it.
    One possible response is to divide both sides by 3.
    Instead, let's rephrase this as multiplying by <m>3^{-1} = \frac
    13</m>, the multiplicative inverse of 3.  
    </p>

    <p> Now that we are interested in solving equations of the form
    <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m>, we might try to find a similar approach.
    Is there a matrix <m>A^{-1}</m> that plays the role of the
    multiplicative inverse of <m>A</m>?  Of course, the real number
    <m>0</m> does not have a multiplicative inverse so we probably
    shouldn't expect every matrix to have a multiplicative inverse.
    We will see, however, that many do.
    </p>

	<idx> invertible </idx>
	<idx> matrix, inverse </idx>
	<p> An <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is called
	<em>invertible</em> if there is a matrix <m>B</m> such that
	<m>AB = I_n</m>, where <m>I_n</m> is the <m>n\times n</m>
	identity matrix.  The matrix <m>B</m> is called the
	<em>inverse</em> of <m>A</m> and denoted <m>A^{-1}</m>.

      <idx> matrix, square </idx> Notice that we only define
      invertibility for matrices that have the same number of rows and
      columns in which case we say that the matrix is <em>square</em>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Suppose that <m>A</m> is the matrix that rotates
	  two-dimensional vectors counterclockwise by <m>90^\circ</m>

	<p>
	  Notice that if we multiply the matrices in the opposite
	  order, we find that <m>BA=I</m>, which says that
	  <m>B</m> is also invertible and that <m>B^{-1} = A</m>.  In

    <activity>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  This activity demonstrates a procedure for finding the
	  inverse of a matrix <m>A</m>.

	  <ol marker="a.">
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Suppose that <m>A = \begin{bmatrix}
		3 \amp -2 \\
		1 \amp -1 \\
		\end{bmatrix}
		</m>.  To find an inverse <m>B</m>, we write its columns
		as <m>B = \begin{bmatrix}\bvec_1 \amp \bvec_2

		  \begin{aligned}
		  AB \amp = I \\

		  \amp = 
		  \begin{bmatrix}
		  1 \amp 0 \\
		  0 \amp 1 \\
		  \end{bmatrix}.
		  \end{aligned}
		</me>
		In other words, we can find the columns of <m>B</m> by
		solving the equations
		<me>
		  A\bvec_1 = \twovec10,~~~
		  A\bvec_2 = \twovec01.
		</me>
		Solve these equations to find <m>\bvec_1</m> and
		<m>\bvec_2</m>.  Then write the matrix <m>B</m> and
		verify that <m>AB=I</m>.  This is enough for us to
		conclude that <m>B</m> is
		the inverse of <m>A</m>.

	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <p>
		We now develop a condition that must be satisfied by

		This says that the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is
		consistent and that <m>\xvec=B\bvec</m> is a solution.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Since we know that <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is consistent

	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Since <m>A</m> is a square matrix,

		Find the reduced row echelon form of each and explain

	  <li><p>
	    Since the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is consistent for

    <example xml:id="example-inverse-augment-I">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  We can reformulate this procedure for finding the inverse of a
	  matrix.  For the sake of convenience, suppose that <m>A</m> is a
	  <m>2\times2</m> invertible matrix with inverse
	  <m>B=\begin{bmatrix} \bvec_1 \amp \bvec_2 \end{bmatrix}</m>.  
	  Rather than solving the equations
	  <me>
	    A\bvec_1 = \twovec10,~~~
	    A\bvec_2 = \twovec01
	  </me>
	  separately, we can solve them at the same time by augmenting
	  <m>A</m> by both vectors <m>\twovec10</m> and <m>\twovec01</m>
	  and finding the reduced row echelon form.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  For example, if
	  <m>A =
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  1 \amp 2 \\
	  1 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}</m>,
	  we form
	  <me>
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rr|rr}
	    1 \amp 2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	    1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	    \end{array}

	    \sim
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rr|rr}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	    \end{array}
	    \right].
	  </me>
	  This shows that the matrix
	  <m> B =
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  -1 \amp 2 \\
	  1 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}
	  </m> is the inverse of <m>A</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In other words, beginning with <m>A</m>, we augment by the

	  <m>A^{-1}</m>:
	  <me>
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{r|r}
	    A \amp I \\

      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      In fact, this reformulation will always work.  Suppose that
      <m>A</m> is an invertible <m>n\times n</m> matrix with inverse
      <m>B</m>.  Suppose furthermore that
      <m>\bvec</m> is any <m>n</m>-dimensional vector and consider the
      equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m>.  We know that <m>x=B\bvec</m> is
      a solution because
      <m>
	A(B\bvec) = (AB)\bvec = I\bvec = \bvec.
      </m>
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="proposition-inverse-solve">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  If <m>A</m> is an invertible matrix with inverse <m>B</m>,
	  then any equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is consistent and
	  <m>\xvec = B\bvec</m> is a solution.  In other words, the
	  solution to <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is <m>\xvec =
	  A^{-1}\bvec</m>. 
	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      Notice that this is similar to saying that the solution to
      <m>3x=5</m> is <m>x = \frac13\cdot 5</m>, as we saw in the
      preview activity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now since <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> is consistent for every vector
      <m>\bvec</m>, the columns of <m>A</m>
      must span <m>\real^n</m> so there is a pivot position in every
      row.  Since <m>A</m> is also square, this means that the reduced
      row echelon form of <m>A</m> is the identity matrix.  
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="proposition-invertible-rref">
      <statement>

	  The matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if

	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      You may have noticed that <xref
      ref="proposition-inverse-solve"/> says that <em>the</em>
      solution to the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is <m>\xvec =
      A^{-1}\bvec</m>.  Indeed, we know that this equation has a
      unique solution because <m>A</m> has a pivot position in every
      column.

      It is important to remember that the product of two matrices
      depends on the order in which they are multiplied.  That is, if
      <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are matrices, then it sometimes happens
      that <m>CD \neq DC</m>.  However, something fortunate happens
      when we consider invertibility.  It turns out that if <m>A</m> is an
      <m>n\times n</m> matrix and that <m>AB=I</m>, then it is also
      true that <m>BA=I</m>.  We have verified this in a few examples
      so far, and <xref ref="ex-right-inverse" /> explains why it 
      always happens.  This leads to the following proposition.

    <proposition xml:id="proposition-inverse-inverse">

    <p>
      With some of the ideas we've developed, we can recast the

      and invertibility.  This will be especially helpful later when
      we consider

	<idx> lower triangular matrix </idx>
	<idx> upper triangular matrix </idx>
	<p> We say that a matrix <m>A</m> is <em>lower triangular</em>
	if all its entries above the diagonal are zero.  Similarly,
	<m>A</m> is <em>upper triangular</em> if all the entries below
	the diagonal are zero.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p> For example, the matrix <m>L</m> below is a lower triangular
    matrix while <m>U</m> is an upper triangular one.

    <p> We can develop a simple test to determine whether an

      Because the entries on the diagonal are nonzero, we find a pivot
      position in every row, which tells us that the matrix is
      invertible.

    <p>
      If, however, there is a zero entry on the diagonal,
      the matrix cannot be invertible.  Considering the matrix below,

      a pivot position.

	    Continuing with the Gaussian elimination algorithm, we

	    Each of the matrices <m>L_1</m>, <m>L_2</m>, and

      The following are examples of matrices, known as 
      <em>elementary matrices</em>,
      that perform the row operations on a matrix having three rows.
      <dl>
	<li><title> Replacement </title>
	<p> Multiplying the second row by 3 and adding it to the third
	row is performed by

	  0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 3 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}.
	</me>  We often use <m>L</m> to describe these matrices because
	they are lower triangular.
	</p></li>
	<li><title> Scaling </title>
	<p> Multiplying the third row by 2 is performed by
	<me>
	  S = \begin{bmatrix}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}.
	</me>
	</p></li>

	<li><title> Interchange </title>
	<p> Interchanging the first two rows is performed by
	<me>
	  P = \begin{bmatrix}
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\

	  0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}.
	</me>
	</p></li>
      </dl>
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> Suppose we have 
	<me>
	  A = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 3 \amp -2 \\
	  -3 \amp -6 \amp 3 \\
	  2 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	  \end{array}\right].
	</me>
	For the forward substitution phase of Gaussian elimination, we
	perform a sequence of three replacement operations.
	The first replacement operation multiplies the first row
	by <m>3</m> and adds the result to the second row.  We can perform
	this operation by multiplying <m>A</m> by the lower triangular
	matrix <m>L_1</m> where 
	<me>
	  L_1A =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  3 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 3 \amp -2 \\
	  -3 \amp -6 \amp 3 \\
	  2 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  = 
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 3 \amp -2 \\
	  0 \amp 3 \amp -3 \\
	  2 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	  \end{array}\right].
	  </me>
	</p>

	<p> The next two replacement operations are performed by the
	matrices
	<me>
	  L_2 = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	  -2 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right],
	  \hspace{24pt}
	  L_3 = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 2 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>
	so that
	<me>L_3L_2L_1A = U = \begin{bmatrix}
	1 \amp 3 \amp -2 \\
	0 \amp 3 \amp -3 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp -4 \\
	\end{bmatrix}.
	</me>
	</p>
	
	<p> Notice that the inverse of <m>L_1</m> has the simple form:
	<me>
	  L_1 = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  3 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right],
	  \hspace{24pt}
	  L_1^{-1} = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  -3 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  </me>.
	  This says that if we want to undo the operation of multiplying
	  the first row by <m>3</m> and adding to the second row, we should
	  multiply the first row by <m>-3</m> and add it to the second row.
	  That is the effect of <m>L_1^{-1}</m>.
	</p>
	
	<p> Notice that we now have <m>L_3L_2L_1A = U</m>, which gives
	<me>
	  \begin{aligned}
	  (L_3L_2L_1)A \amp = U \\
	  (L_3L_2L_1)^{-1}(L_3L_2L_1)A \amp = 
	  (L_3L_2L_1)^{-1}U \\
	  A \amp = (L_3L_2L_1)^{-1}U = LU\\
	  \end{aligned}
	</me>
	where <m>L</m> is the lower triangular matrix
	<me> L = (L_3L_2L_1)^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	-3 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	2 \amp -2 \amp 1 \\
	\end{bmatrix}.
	</me>
	This way of writing <m>A=LU</m> as the product of a lower and
	an upper triangular matrix is known as an <m>LU</m>
	factorization of <m>A</m>, and its usefulness will be explored
	in <xref ref="sec-gaussian-revisited"/>.

    <title> Summary </title>

    <p> In this section, we found conditions guaranteeing that a
    matrix has an inverse.  When these conditions hold, we also found
    an algorithm for finding the inverse.
    <ul>
      <li><p> A square matrix is invertible if there is a matrix
      <m>B</m>, known as the inverse of <m>A</m>, such that <m>AB =
      I</m>.  We usually write <m>A^{-1} = B</m>.  </p></li>

      <li><p> The <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> is
      invertible if and only if it is row equivalent to <m>I_n</m>,
      the <m>n\times n</m> identity matrix. </p></li>

      <li><p> If a matrix <m>A</m> is invertible, we can use Gaussian 
      elimination to find its inverse:
      <me>
	\left[\begin{array}{r|r} A \amp I \end{array}\right] \sim 
	\left[\begin{array}{r|r} I \amp A^{-1} \end{array}\right]
      </me>. </p></li>

      <li><p> If a matrix <m>A</m> is invertible, then the solution to
      the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is <m>\xvec =
      A^{-1}\bvec</m>. </p></li> 

      <li><p> The row operations of replacement, scaling, and
      interchange can be performed 
      by multiplying by elementary
      matrices.  </p></li>
    </ul>
