    Linear independence
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous section, questions about the existence of
      solutions of a linear system led to the concept of the span of
      a set of vectors.  In particular, the span of a set of vectors
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is the set of vectors
      <m>\bvec</m> for which a solution to the linear system <m>
      \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
      \vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\ldots\amp\vvec_n \end{array}\right] ~\xvec
      = \bvec </m> exists.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we turn to the uniqueness of solutions of a
      linear system, the second of our <xref
      ref="fundamental-questions" text="custom"> two fundamental
      questions</xref>.  This will lead us to the concept of linear
      independence.

      <introduction>
        <p>
	  Let's begin by looking at some sets of vectors in
	  <m>\real^3</m>.  As we saw in the previous section, the span of
	  a set of vectors in <m>\real^3</m> will be either a line, a
	  plane, or <m>\real^3</m> itself.

  <subsection>
    <title> Linear dependence </title>
    <p>
      We have seen examples where the span of a set of three vectors in
      <m>\real^3</m> is <m>\real^3</m> and other examples where the
      span of three vectors is a plane.  We would like to understand
      the difference between these two situations.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-span-r3">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Let's consider the set of three vectors in <m>\real^3</m>:
	  <me>
	    \vvec_1 = \threevec220,~~~
	    \vvec_2 = \threevec11{-1},~~~
	    \vvec_3 = \threevec{-1}01.
	  </me>
	  Forming the associated matrix gives
	  <me>
	    \begin{bmatrix}\vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\vvec_3\end{bmatrix}
	    = 
	    \begin{bmatrix}
	    2 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	    2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp -1 \amp 1 \\
	    \end{bmatrix}
	    \sim
	    \begin{bmatrix}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	    \end{bmatrix}.
	  </me>
	  Because there is a pivot position in every row, 
	  <xref ref="prop-pivot-row" /> tells us that
	  <m>\laspan{\vvec_1, \vvec_2, \vvec_3} = \real^3</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-span-plane">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Now let's consider the set of three vectors:
	  <me>
	    \wvec_1 = \threevec220,~~~
	    \wvec_2 = \threevec11{-1},~~~
	    \wvec_3 = \threevec{-5}{-5}{1}.
	  </me>
	  Forming the associated matrix gives
	  <me>
	    \begin{bmatrix}\wvec_1\amp\wvec_2\amp\wvec_3\end{bmatrix}
	    = 
	    \begin{bmatrix}
	    2 \amp 1 \amp -5 \\
	    2 \amp 1 \amp -5 \\
	    0 \amp -1 \amp 1 \\
	    \end{bmatrix}
	    \sim
	    \begin{bmatrix}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	    \end{bmatrix}.
	  </me>
	  Since the last row does not have a pivot position, we know
	  that the span of these vectors is not <m>\real^3</m> but is
	  instead a plane.
	</p>

	<p>
	  In fact, we can say more if we shift our perspective
	  slightly and view this as an augmented matrix:
	  <me>
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rr|r}\wvec_1\amp\wvec_2\amp\wvec_3
	    \end{array}
	    \right]
	    =
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rr|r}
	    2 \amp 1 \amp -5 \\
	    2 \amp 1 \amp -5 \\
	    0 \amp -1 \amp 1 \\
	    \end{array}
	    \right]
	    \sim
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rr|r}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	    \end{array}
	    \right].
	  </me>
	  In this way, we see that <m>\wvec_3 = -2\wvec_1 -
	  \wvec_2</m>, which enables us to rewrite any linear
	  combination of these three vectors:
	  <me>
	    \begin{aligned}
	    c_1\wvec_1 + c_2\wvec_2 + c_3\wvec_3 \amp
	    {}={}
	    c_1\wvec_1 + c_2\wvec_2 + c_3(-2\wvec_1-\wvec_2) \\
	    \amp {}={}
	    (c_1-2c_3)\wvec_1 + (c_2-c_3)\wvec_2. \\
	    \end{aligned}
	  </me>
	</p>
	  
	<p>
	  In other words, any linear combination of <m>\wvec_1</m>,
	  <m>\wvec_2</m>, and <m>\wvec_3</m> may be written as a linear
	  combination using only the vectors <m>\wvec_1</m> and
	  <m>\wvec_2</m>.  Since the span of a set of vectors is simply
	  the set of their linear combinations, this shows that
	  <me>
	    \laspan{\wvec_1,\wvec_2,\wvec_3} = \laspan{\wvec_1,\wvec_2}.
	  </me>
	  As a result, adding the vector <m>\wvec_3</m> to the set of
	  vectors <m>\wvec_1</m> and <m>\wvec_2</m> does not change the
	  span.
	</p>

      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>
      Before exploring this type of behavior more generally,
      let's think about it from a geometric point of view.  Suppose
      that we begin with the two vectors <m>\vvec_1</m> and
      <m>\vvec_2</m> in <xref ref="example-span-r3"/>.  The span of
      these two vectors is a plane in <m>\real^3</m>, as seen on the
      left of <xref ref="figure-span-r3"/>.

            <p>Two three dimensional vectors <m>\vvec_1</m> and
            <m>\vvec_2</m> are shown along with the plane formed by

          </description>
        </image>
      </sidebyside>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Because the vector <m>\vvec_3</m> is not a linear combination of
      <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>, it provides a direction to move
      that is independent of
      <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  Adding this third vector
      <m>\vvec_3</m> therefore forms a set whose span is
      <m>\real^3</m>, as seen on the right of <xref
      ref="figure-span-r3"/>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Similarly, the span of the vectors <m>\wvec_1</m> and
      <m>\wvec_2</m> in <xref ref="example-span-plane"/> is also a
      plane.  However, the third vector <m>\wvec_3</m> is a linear
      combination of <m>\wvec_1</m> and <m>\wvec_2</m>, which means
      that it already lies in the plane formed by <m>\wvec_1</m> and
      <m>\wvec_2</m>, as seen in <xref
      ref="figure-span-plane"/>.
      Since we can already move in this direction using just 
      <m>\wvec_1</m> and <m>\wvec_2</m>, adding
      <m>\wvec_3</m> to the set does not change the span.  As a
      result, it remains a plane.

      What distinguishes these two examples is whether one of the
      vectors is a linear combination of the others, an observation
      that leads to the following definition.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="definition-linear-independence">
      <idx> linearly independent </idx>
      <idx> linearly dependent </idx>
      <statement>
	<p> A set of vectors is
	called <em> linearly dependent </em> if one of the vectors is
	a linear combination of the others.  Otherwise, the set of
	vectors is called <em> linearly independent</em>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p> For the sake of completeness, we say that a set of vectors
    containing only one nonzero vector is linearly independent.

      <solution>
	<p><ol marker="a.">
	  <li><p>
	    Let's focus on the first three vectors and view the matrix
	    as an augmented one:
	    <me>
	      \left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
	      \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \vvec_3
	      \end{array}\right]
	      \sim
	      \left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
	      1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \\
	      0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \\
	      0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	      0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	      \end{array}\right]\text{.}
	    </me>
	    This shows that <m>\vvec_3=-\vvec_1+2\vvec_2</m> so it is
	    possible to write one of the vectors as a linear
	    combination of the others.  
	    Therefore, the set is linearly dependent.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>
	    Applying the same reasoning as in the previous part, we
	    see that we cannot write any of the vectors as a linear
	    combination of the others.  Therefore, the set is linearly
	    independent.   
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>
	    The columns of a matrix are linearly independent exactly
	    when there is a pivot position in every column of the
	    matrix.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>
	    No, because we can write the zero vector <m>\zerovec</m>
	    as a linear combination of the other vectors: <m>\zerovec
	    = 0\vvec_2 + \ldots + 0\vvec_n</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>
	    No, because the matrix formed by the vectors would have 12
	    columns and only 10 rows.  There can be at most 10 pivot
	    positions so there are at least two columns without pivot
	    positions.
	  </p></li>
	</ol></p>
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p>
      By now, we should expect that the pivot positions
      play an important role in determining whether the columns of a
      matrix are linearly dependent.  For instance, suppose we have
      four vectors and their associated matrix
      <me>
	\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	\vvec_1 \amp 	  \vvec_2 \amp 	  \vvec_3 \amp
	\vvec_4 
	\end{array}\right]
	\sim
	\left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 1 \amp -3 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	\end{array}\right].
      </me>
      Since the third column does not contain a pivot position,
      let's just focus on the first three columns and view them
      as an augmented matrix:
      <me>
	\left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
	\vvec_1 \amp 	  \vvec_2 \amp 	  \vvec_3 
	\end{array}\right]
	\sim
	\left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\
	0 \amp 1 \amp -3 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	\end{array}\right].
      </me>
      This says that 
      <me>
	\vvec_3 = 2\vvec_1 -3\vvec_2,
      </me>
      which tells us that the set of vectors
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_3,\vvec_4</m> is linearly dependent.
      Moreover, we see that
      <me>
	\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_3,\vvec_4} =
	\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_4}.
      </me>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      More generally, the same reasoning implies that a set of
      vectors is linearly dependent if the associated matrix has a
      column without a pivot position.  Indeed, as illustrated here,
      a vector corresponding to a column without a pivot
      position can be expressed as a linear combination of the
      vectors whose columns do contain pivot positions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Suppose instead that the matrix associated to a set of vectors 
      has a pivot position in every column.
      <me>
	\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	\wvec_1 \amp 	  \wvec_2 \amp 	  \wvec_3 \amp \wvec_4 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	\sim
	\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0\\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	\end{array}\right].
      </me>
      Viewing this as an augmented matrix again, we see
      that the linear system is inconsistent since there is a pivot in
      the rightmost column, which means that <m>\wvec_4</m> cannot be
      expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors.
      Similarly, <m>\wvec_3</m> cannot be expressed as a linear
      combination of <m>\wvec_1</m> and <m>\wvec_2</m>. In
      fact, none of the vectors can be written as a linear
      combination of the others so this set of vectors is linearly
      independent. 
    </p>
    
      
    <p> The following proposition summarizes these findings. </p>
    
    <proposition>
      <statement>
	<p> The columns of a matrix are linearly independent if and
	only if every column contains a pivot position.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      This condition imposes a constraint on how many vectors we can
      have in a linearly independent set.  Here is an example of the
      reduced row echelon form of a matrix whose columns form a set of
      three linearly independent vectors in <m>\real^5</m>:
      <me>
	\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	\end{array}\right].
      </me>
      Notice that there are at least as many rows as columns, which
      must be the case if every column is to have a pivot position.
    </p>

    <p>
      More generally, if
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is a 
      linearly independent set of vectors in <m>\real^m</m>,
      the associated matrix must have a
      pivot position in every column.  Since every row
      contains at most one pivot position, the number of columns can
      be no greater than the number of rows.
      This means that the number of vectors in a linearly independent
      set can be no greater than the number of dimensions.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-linear-indep-bound">
      <statement>
	<p> A linearly independent set of vectors in <m>\real^m</m>
	contains at most <m>m</m> vectors.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
	
    <p>
      This says, for instance, that any linearly independent
      set of vectors in <m>\real^3</m> can contain no more three
      vectors.  We usually
      imagine three independent directions, such as up/down,
      front/back, left/right, in our three-dimensional world.  This
      proposition tells us that there can be no more independent
      directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The proposition above says that a set of vectors in
      <m>\real^m</m> that is linear independent has at most
      <m>m</m> vectors.  By comparison,
      <xref ref="prop-span-bound"/> says that a set of vectors 
      whose span is <m>\real^m</m> has at least
      <m>m</m> vectors.

    <p>
      This activity shows how the solution space of the homogeneous
      equation <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m> indicates whether the columns
      of <m>A</m> are linearly dependent or independent.  First, we
      know that the equation <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m> always has at
      least 
      one solution, the vector <m>\xvec = \zerovec</m>.  Any
      other solution is a nonzero solution.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Let's consider the vectors
	  <me>
	    \vvec_1 = \fourvec2{-4}10,~~~
	    \vvec_2 = \fourvec113{-2},~~~
	    \vvec_3 = \fourvec3{-3}4{-2}
	  </me>
	  and their associated matrix
	  <m>A = \begin{bmatrix}
	  \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \vvec_3
	  \end{bmatrix}
	  </m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The homogeneous equation <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m> has the
	  associated augmented matrix
	  <me>
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rrr|r}
	    2 \amp 1 \amp 3 \amp 0 \\
	    -4 \amp 1 \amp -3 \amp 0 \\
	    1 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp -2 \amp -2 \amp 0 \\

	    \sim
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rrr|r}

	    0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	    \end{array}
	    \right].
	  </me>
	  Therefore, <m>A</m> has a column without a
	  pivot position, which tells us that the vectors
	  <m>\vvec_1</m>, <m>\vvec_2</m>, and <m>\vvec_3</m> are
	  linearly dependent.  However, we can also see this fact in
	  another way.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The reduced row echelon matrix tells us that the homogeneous
	  equation has a free variable so that there must be
	  infinitely many solutions.  In particular, we have
	  <me>
	    \begin{aligned}
	    x_1 \amp {}={} -x_3 \\
	    x_2 \amp {}={} -x_3 \\
	    \end{aligned}
	  </me>
	  so the solutions have the form
	  <me>
	    \xvec = \threevec{x_1}{x_2}{x_3} =
	    \threevec{-x_3}{-x_3}{x_3} = x_3\threevec{-1}{-1}1.
	  </me>
	</p>

	<p>
	  If we choose <m>x_3=1</m>, then we obtain the nonzero
	  solution to the homogeneous equation <m>\xvec =
	  \threevec{-1}{-1}1</m>, which implies that
	  <me>
	    A\threevec{-1}{-1}1 =
	    \begin{bmatrix}
	    \vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\vvec_3
	    \end{bmatrix}
	    \threevec{-1}{-1}1 =
	    -\vvec_1 -\vvec_2 + \vvec_3 = \zerovec.
	  </me>
	  In other words,
	  <me>
	    \begin{aligned}
	    -\vvec_1 -\vvec_2 + \vvec_3 \amp{}={} \zerovec \\
	    \vvec_3 \amp{}={} \vvec_1 + \vvec_2. \\
	    \end{aligned}
	  </me>
	</p>

	<p>
	  Because <m>\vvec_3</m> is a linear combination of
	  <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>, we know that this set of
	  vectors is linearly dependent.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </example>
	    
    <p>
      As this example demonstrates, there are many ways we can view
      the question of linear independence, some of which are recorded 
      in the following proposition.

      Summary
    </title>

    <p> This section developed the concept of linear dependence
    of a set of vectors.  More specifically, we saw that:
    <ul>
      <li><p> A set of vectors is linearly dependent if one of the
      vectors is a linear combination of the others. </p></li>

      <li><p> A set of vectors is linearly independent if and only if
      the vectors form a matrix that has a pivot position in every
      column. </p></li>

      <li><p> A set of linearly independent vectors in <m>\real^m</m>
      contains no more than <m>m</m> vectors. </p></li>

      <li><p> The columns of the matrix <m>A</m> are linearly
      dependent if the homogeneous equation <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m>
      has a nonzero solution. </p></li>

      <li><p> A set of vectors <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m>
      is linearly dependent if there are weights
      <m>c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n</m>, not all of which are zero, such that
      <me>
	c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2 + \ldots + c_n\vvec_n = \zerovec
      </me>.
      </p></li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>
      At the beginning of the section, we said
      that this concept addressed the second of our 
      <xref ref="fundamental-questions" text="custom">
	two fundamental questions
      </xref>
      concerning the uniqueness of solutions to a linear system.  It is
      worth comparing the results of this section with those of the
      previous one so that the parallels between them become clear.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As usual, we will write a matrix as a collection
      of vectors,
      <me>A=\left[\begin{array}{rrrr} \vvec_1\amp\vvec_2 \amp
      \ldots \amp \vvec_n \end{array}\right].
