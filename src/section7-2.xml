  <introduction>

    <p>
      With our understanding of symmetric matrices and variance in
      hand, we'll now explore how to determine the directions in which
      the variance of a dataset is as large as possible and where it
      is as small as possible.  This is part of a much larger story
      involving a type of function, called a <em>quadratic form</em>,
      that we'll introduce here.

  <subsection>
    <title> Quadratic forms </title>

    <p>
      Given a matrix <m>A</m> of <m>N</m> demeaned data points,
      the symmetric covariance matrix <m>C=\frac1N AA^T</m> determines
      the variance in a particular direction
      <me>
	V_{\uvec} = \uvec\cdot(C\uvec),
      </me>
      where <m>\uvec</m> is a unit vector defining the direction.
    </p>

    <p>
      More generally, a symmetric <m>m\times m</m> matrix
      <m>A</m> defines a function <m>q:\real^m \to \real</m>
      by
      <me>
	q(\xvec) = \xvec\cdot(A\xvec).
      </me>
      Notice that this expression is similar to the one we use to find
      the variance <m>V_{\uvec}</m> in terms of the covariance matrix
      <m>C</m>.  The only difference is that we allow <m>\xvec</m> to
      be any vector rather than requiring it to be a unit vector.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Suppose that
	  <m>A=\begin{bmatrix}
	  1 \amp 2\\
	  2 \amp 1
	  \end{bmatrix}
	  </m>.  If we write <m>\xvec=\twovec{x_1}{x_2}</m>, then we have
	  <md>
	    <mrow>
	      q\left(\twovec {x_1}{x_2}\right) \amp = \twovec
	      {x_1}{x_2} \cdot
	      \left(
	      \begin{bmatrix}
	      1 \amp 2 \\
	      2 \amp 1
	      \end{bmatrix}
	      \twovec {x_1}{x_2}
	      \right)
	    </mrow>
	    <mrow>
	      \amp = \twovec {x_1}{x_2} \cdot
	      \twovec{x_1 + 2x_2}{2x_1 + x_2}
	    </mrow>
	    <mrow>
	      \amp = x_1^2 + 2x_1x_2 + 2x_1x_2 + x_2^2
	    </mrow>
	    <mrow>
	      \amp = x_1^2 + 4x_1x_2 + x_2^2.
	    </mrow>
	  </md>
	</p>

	<p>
	  We may evaluate the quadratic form using some input vectors:
	  <me>
	    q\left(\twovec 10\right) = 1, \hspace{24pt}
	    q\left(\twovec 11\right) = 6, \hspace{24pt}
	    q\left(\twovec 24\right) = 52.
	  </me>
	  Notice that the value of the quadratic form is a scalar.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </example>

      <idx> quadratic form </idx>
      <statement>

    <p>
      Linear algebra is principally about things that are linear.
      However, quadratic forms, as the name implies,  
      have a distinctly non-linear character.  First, if
      <m>A=\begin{bmatrix} a \amp b \\ b \amp c \end{bmatrix}</m>, is
      a symmetric matrix, then the associated quadratic form is
      <me>
	q_A\left(\twovec{x_1}{x_2}\right) = ax_1^2 + 2bx_1x_2 + cx_2^2.
      </me>
      Notice how the variables <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are multiplied
      together, which tells us this isn't a linear function.
    </p>

    <p>
      This expression assumes an especially simple form when
      <m>D</m> is a diagonal matrix.  In particular, if
      <m>D = \begin{bmatrix}
      a \amp 0 \\
      0 \amp c \\
      \end{bmatrix}
      </m>, then <m>q_D\left(\twovec{x_1}{x_2}\right) = ax_1^2 +
      cx_2^2</m>.  This is special because there is no cross-term
      involving <m>x_1x_2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember that matrix transformations have the property that
      <m>T(s\xvec) = sT(\xvec)</m>.  Quadratic forms behave
      differently:
      <me>
	q_A(s\xvec) = (s\xvec)\cdot(A(s\xvec)) = s^2\xvec\cdot(A\xvec)=
	s^2q_A(\xvec).
      </me>
      For instance, when we multiply <m>\xvec</m> by the scalar 2,
      then <m>q_A(2\xvec) = 4q_A(\xvec)</m>.  Also, notice that
      <m>q_A(-\xvec) = q_A(\xvec)</m> since the scalar is squared.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, evaluating a quadratic form on an eigenvector has a
      particularly simple form.  Suppose that <m>\xvec</m> is an
      eigenvector of <m>A</m> with associated eigenvalue
      <m>\lambda</m>.  We then have
      <me>
	q_A(\xvec) = \xvec\cdot(A\xvec) = \lambda\xvec\cdot\xvec =
	\lambda \len{\xvec}^2.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's now return to our motivating question:  in which direction
      <m>\uvec</m> is the variance <m>V_{\uvec}=\uvec\cdot(C\uvec)</m>
      of a dataset as 
      large as possible 
      and in which is it as small as possible.  Remembering that the
      vector <m>\uvec</m> is a unit vector, we can now state a more
      general form of this question:
      <em>
	If <m>q_A(\xvec)</m> is a quadratic form, for which unit
	vectors	<m>\uvec</m> is <m>q_A(\uvec)=\uvec\cdot(A\uvec)</m>
	as large as 
	possible and for which is it as small as possible?
      </em>
      Since a unit vector specifies a direction, we will often ask for
      the directions in which the quadratic form <m>q(\xvec)</m> is at
      its maximum or minimum value.
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  We can gain some intuition about this problem by graphing the
	  quadratic form and paying particular attention to the unit
	  vectors.

    <p>
      This activity demonstrates how the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>
      determine the maximum and minimum values of the quadratic form
      <m>q_A(\uvec)</m> when evaluated on unit vectors and how the
      associated eigenvectors determine the directions in which the
      maximum and minimum values occur.  Let's look at another example
      so that this connection is clear.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Consider the symmetric matrix
	  <m>A=\begin{bmatrix}
	  -7 \amp -6 \\
	  -6 \amp 2 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}</m>.  Because <m>A</m> is symmetric, we know
	  that it can be orthogonally diagonalized.  In fact, we have
	  <m>A=QDQ^T</m> where
	  <me>
	    D = \begin{bmatrix}
	    5 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp -10 \\
	    \end{bmatrix},\hspace{24pt}
	    Q = \begin{bmatrix}
	    1/\sqrt{5} \amp 2/\sqrt{5} \\
	    -2/\sqrt{5} \amp 1/\sqrt{5} \\
	    \end{bmatrix}\text{.}
	  </me>
	  From this diagonalization, we know that <m>\lambda_1=5</m> is
	  the largest eigenvalue of <m>A</m> with associated
	  eigenvector <m>\uvec_1 =
	  \twovec{1/\sqrt{5}}{-2/\sqrt{5}}</m> and that <m>\lambda_2 =
	  -10</m> is the smallest eigenvalue with associated
	  eigenvector <m>\uvec_2 =
	  \twovec{2/\sqrt{5}}{1/\sqrt{5}}</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Let's first study the quadratic form <m>q_D(\uvec) = 5u_1^2
	  - 10u_2^2</m> because the absence of the cross-term makes it
	  comparatively simple.  Remembering that <m>\uvec</m> is a unit
	  vector, we have <m>u_1^2+u_2^2=1</m>, which means that
	  <m>u_1^2 = 1-u_2^2</m>.  Therefore,
	  <me>
	    q_D(\uvec) = 5u_1^2 - 10u_2^2 = 5(1-u_2^2)-10u_2^2 = 5 -
	    15u_2^2\text{.}
	  </me>
	  This tells us that <m>q_D(\uvec)</m> has a maximum value of
	  <m>5</m>, which occurs when <m>u_2=0</m> or in the direction
	  <m>\twovec10</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  In the same way, rewriting <m>u_2^2 = 1-u_1^2</m> allows us
	  to conclude that the minimum value of <m>q_D(\uvec)</m> is
	  <m>-10</m>, which occurs in the direction <m>\twovec01</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Let's now return to the matrix <m>A</m> whose quadratic form
	  <m>q_A</m> is related to <m>q_D</m> because <m>A =
	  QDQ^T</m>.  In particular, we have
	  <me>
	    q_A(\uvec) = \uvec\cdot(A\uvec) = \uvec\cdot(QDQ^T\uvec) =
	    (Q^T\uvec)\cdot(DQ^T\uvec) = \vvec\cdot(D\vvec) =
	    q_D(\vvec)\text{.} 
	  </me>
	  In other words, we have <m>q_A(\uvec) = q_D(\vvec)</m>
	  where <m>\vvec=Q^T\uvec</m>.  This is quite useful because
	  it allows us to relate the values of <m>q_A</m> to those of
	  <m>q_D</m>, which we already understand quite well.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Now it turns out that <m>\vvec</m> is also a unit vector
	  because
	  <me>
	    |\vvec|^2 = \vvec\cdot\vvec = (Q^T\uvec)\cdot(Q^T\uvec) =
	    \uvec\cdot(QQ^T\uvec) = \uvec\cdot\uvec = |\uvec|^2 = 1\text.
	  </me>
	  Therefore, the maximum value of <m>q_A(\uvec)</m> is the
	  same as <m>q_D(\vvec)</m>, which we know to be <m>5</m> and
	  which occurs in the direction <m>\vvec=\twovec10</m>.  This
	  means that the maximum value of <m>q_A(\uvec)</m> is also
	  <m>5</m> and that this occurs in the direction <m>\uvec =
	  Q\vvec = Q\twovec10 = \twovec{1/\sqrt{5}}{-2/\sqrt{5}}</m>.
	  We now know that the maximum value of <m>q_A(\uvec)</m> is
	  the largest eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1=5</m> and that this
	  maximum value occurs in the direction of an associated
	  eigenvector. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  In the same way, we see that the minimum value of
	  <m>q_A(\uvec)</m> is the smallest eigenvalue
	  <m>\lambda_2=-10</m> and that this minimum occurs in the
	  direction of <m>\uvec=Q\twovec01 =
	  \twovec{2/\sqrt{5}}{1/\sqrt{5}}</m>, an associated
	  eigenvector.
	</p>
      </statement>

      More generally, we have
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-quadform-extrema">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Suppose that <m>A</m> is a symmetric matrix, that we list

	  <m>\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \ldots \geq \lambda_m</m>, and that
	  <m>\uvec_1,\uvec_2,\ldots,\uvec_m</m> is a basis
	  of associated eigenvectors.
	  The maximum value of
	  <m>q_A(\uvec)</m> among all unit vectors <m>\uvec</m> is 
	  <m>\lambda_1</m>, which occurs in the direction
	  <m>\uvec_1</m>.  Similarly, the minimum value of
	  <m>q_A(\uvec)</m> is <m>\lambda_m</m>, which occurs in the
	  direction <m>\uvec_m</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

      We've been focused on finding the directions in which a
      quadratic form attains its maximum and minimum values, but
      there's another important observation to make after this
      activity.  Recall how we used the fact that a symmetric matrix
      is orthogonally diagonalizable: if <m>A=QDQ^T</m>, then
      <m>q_A(\uvec) = q_D(\vvec)</m> where <m>\vvec = Q^T\uvec</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      More generally, if we define <m>\yvec = Q^T\xvec</m>, we have
      <me>
	q_A(\xvec) = \xvec\cdot(A\xvec) =
	\xvec\cdot(QDQ^T\xvec) =
	(Q^T\xvec)\cdot(DQ^T\xvec) =
	\yvec\cdot(D\yvec) = q_D(\yvec)
      </me>
      Remembering that the quadratic form associated to a diagonal
      form has no cross terms, we obtain
      <me>
	q_A(\xvec) = q_D(\yvec) =
	\lambda_1y_1^2 + \lambda_2y_2^2 + \ldots + \lambda_my_m^2.
      </me>
      In other words, after a change of coordinates, the quadratic
      form <m>q_A</m> can be written without cross terms.  This is
      known as the Principal Axes Theorem.

	  orthogonal 
	  change of coordinates <m>\yvec=Q^T\xvec</m>, as
	  <me>
	    q_A(\xvec) =
	    \lambda_1y_1^2 + \lambda_2y_2^2 + \ldots +

    <p>
      While our questions about variance provide some motivation for
      exploring quadratic forms, these functions appear in a variety
      of other contexts so it's worth spending some more time with
      them.  For example, quadratic forms appear in multivariable
      calculus when describing the behavior of a function of several
      variables near a critical point and in physics when describing
      the kinetic energy of a rigid body.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following definition will be important in this section.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  A symmetric matrix <m>A</m> is called <em>positive
	  definite</em> if its associated quadratic form satisfies
	  <m>q_A(\xvec) \gt 0</m> for any nonzero vector
	  <m>\xvec</m>.  If <m>q_A(\xvec) \geq 0</m> for all nonzero
	  vectors <m>\xvec</m>, we say that <m>A</m> is <em>positive 
	  semidefinite</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Likewise, we say that <m>A</m> is <em>negative
	  definite</em> if <m>q_A(\xvec) \lt 0</m> for all nonzero
	  vectors <m>\xvec</m>. 
	</p>

	<p>

      As seen in this activity, it is straightforward to determine the
      definiteness of a diagonal matrix.  For instance, if
      <m>D=\begin{bmatrix} 7 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 5 \end{bmatrix}</m>,
      then
      <me>
	q_D(\xvec) = 7x_1^2 + 5x_2^2.
      </me>
      This shows that <m>q_D(\xvec) \gt 0</m> when either <m>x_1</m>
      or <m>x_2</m> is not zero so we conclude that <m>D</m> is
      positive definite.
      In the same way, we see that <m>D</m> is positive semidefinite
      if all the diagonal entries are nonnegative.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding this behavior for diagonal matrices enables us to
      understand more general symmetric matrices.  As we saw
      previously, the quadratic form for a symmetric matrix
      <m>A=QDQ^T</m> agrees with the quadratic form for the diagonal
      matrix <m>D</m> after a change of coordinates.  In particular,
      <me>
	q_A(\xvec) = q_D(\yvec)
      </me>
      where <m>\yvec=Q^T\xvec</m>.  Now the diagonal entries of
      <m>D</m> are the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> from which we conclude
      that <m>q_A(\xvec) \gt 0</m> if all the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>
      are positive.  Likewise, <m>q_A(\xvec)\geq 0</m> if all the
      eigenvalues are nonnegative.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-definite-matrices">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  A symmetric matrix is positive definite if all its
	  eigenvalues are positive.  It is positive semidefinite if all
	  its eigenvalues are nonnegative.

	<p>
	  Likewise, a symmetric matrix is indefinite if some
	  eigenvalues are positive and some are negative.

      We will now apply what we've learned about quadratic forms to
      study the nature of critical points in multivariable calculus.
      The rest of this section assumes that the reader is familiar
      with ideas from multivariable calculus and can be skipped by
      others.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, suppose that <m>f(x,y)</m> is a differentiable function.
      We will use <m>f_x</m> and <m>f_y</m> to denote the partial
      derivatives of <m>f</m> with respect to <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
      Similarly, <m>f_{xx}</m>, <m>f_{xy}</m>, <m>f_{yx}</m> and
      <m>f_{yy}</m> denote the second partial derivatives.  You may
      recall that the 
      mixed partials, <m>f_{xy}</m> and <m>f_{yx}</m> are equal under
      a mild assumption on the function <m>f</m>.
      A typical question in calculus is to determine where this
      function has its maximum and minimum values.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any local maximum or minimum of <m>f</m> appears at a critical
      point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> where
      <me>
	f_x(x_0,y_0) = 0,\hspace{24pt}
	f_y(x_0,y_0) = 0.
      </me>
      Near a critical point, the quadratic approximation of <m>f</m>
      tells us that
      <md>
	<mrow>
	  f(x,y)\approx f(x_0,y_0) \amp + \frac12
	  f_{xx}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)^2
	</mrow>
	<mrow>
	  \amp + f_{xy}(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)(y-y_0) + \frac12

      Near a critical point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m> of a function

      f_{yx}(x_0,y_0) \amp f_{yy}(x_0,y_0)
      \end{bmatrix}</m>.  If <m>A</m> is positive definite, then

      </me>
      is called the <em>Hessian</em> of <m>f</m>, and we see now that
      the eigenvalues of this symmetric matrix determine the nature of
      the critical point <m>(x_0,y_0)</m>.  In particular, if the

      definite, and the critical point is a local minimum.

	    If <m>A</m> is a symmetric matrix, then the quadratic form
	    defined by <m>A</m> is the function <m>q_A(\xvec) =
	    \xvec\cdot(A\xvec)</m>.
	    Quadratic forms appear when studying the variance of a
	    dataset.  If <m>C</m> is the covariance matrix, then the
	    variance in the direction defined by a unit vector
	    <m>\uvec</m> is <m>q_C(\uvec) =
	    \uvec\cdot(C\uvec)=V_{\uvec}</m>. 
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Similarly, quadratic forms appear in multivariable
	    calculus when analyzing the behavior of a function of
	    several variables near a critical point.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    If <m>\lambda_1</m> is the largest eigenvalue of a
	    symmetric matrix <m>A</m> and <m>\lambda_m</m> the
	    smallest, then the maximum value of <m>q_A(\uvec)</m>
	    among unit vectors <m>\uvec</m>, is <m>\lambda_1</m>,
	    and this maximum value occurs in the direction of
	    <m>\uvec_1</m>, a unit eigenvector associated to
	    <m>\lambda_1</m>.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Similarly, the minimum value of <m>q_A(\uvec)</m> is
	    <m>\lambda_m</m>, which appears in the direction of
	    <m>\uvec_m</m>, an eigenvector associated to
	    <m>\lambda_m</m>.
	  </p>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    A symmetric matrix is positive definite if its eigenvalues
	    are all positive, positive semidefinite if its eigenvalues
	    are all nonnegative, and indefinite if it has both
	    positive and negative eigenvalues.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    If the Hessian <m>H</m> of a multivariable function
	    <m>f</m> is positive definite at a critical point, then
	    the critical point is a local minimum.  Likewise, if the
	    Hessian is negative definite, the critical point is a
	    local maximum.
