  <title>
    Bases and coordinate systems
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Standard Cartesian coordinates are commonly used to describe
    points in the plane.  If we mention the point
    <m>(4,3)</m>, we know that we arrive at this point from the origin
    by moving four units to the right and three units up.
    </p>

    <p> Sometimes, however, it is more natural to work in a different
    coordinate system.  Suppose that you live in the
    city whose map is shown in <xref ref = "fig-city-map" /> and that
    you would like to give a guest directions for getting from your
    house to the store.  You would probably say something like, "Go
    four blocks up Maple.  Then turn left on Main for three blocks."
    The grid of streets in the city gives a more
    natural coordinate system than standard north-south, east-west
    coordinates.

            <p>A street map of a fictitious city with two sets
            of parallel streets and an arrow indicating that north is
            to the top of the map.  One set of streets runs roughly
            southwest to northeast, and one of these streets is
            labelled <q>Maple</q> and has a marked location labelled
            <q>House</q>.  A second set of streets runs roughly
            northwest to southeast and has a street labelled
            <q>Main</q> with a location labelled <q>Store</q>.</p>

    <p> In this section, we will develop the concept of a
    <em>basis</em> through which we will create new coordinate systems
    in <m>\real^m</m>.  We will see that the right choice of a
    coordinate system provides a more natural way to approach some
    problems.

    <p> In the preview activity, we worked with a set of two vectors
    in <m>\real^2</m> and found that we could express any vector in
    <m>\real^2</m> in two different ways:  in the usual way where the
    components of the
    vector describe horizontal and vertical changes, and in a new
    way as a linear combination of <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.
    We could also translate between these two 
    descriptions.  This example illustrates the central idea of this
    section.  </p>

  <subsection>
    <title> Bases </title>

    <p> In the preview activity, we created a new coordinate system
    for <m>\real^2</m> using linear combinations of a set of two
    vectors.  More generally, the following definition will guide us.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
	<idx> basis </idx>
	<p> A set of vectors <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> in
	<m>\real^m</m> is called a <em>basis</em> for <m>\real^m</m>
	if the set of vectors spans <m>\real^m</m> and is linearly
	independent. </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <activity>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  We will look at some examples of bases in this activity.
	  <ol marker="a.">
	    <li><p> In the preview activity, we worked with the set of
	    vectors in <m>\real^2</m>:
	    <me>
	      \vvec_1 = \twovec{2}{1},
	      \vvec_2 = \twovec{1}{2}
	      </me>.
	      Explain why these vectors form a basis for <m>\real^2</m>.
	    </p></li>

	    <li><p> Consider the set of vectors in <m>\real^3</m>
	    <me>
	      \vvec_1 = \threevec{1}{1}{1},
	      \vvec_2 = \threevec{0}{1}{-1},
	      \vvec_3 = \threevec{1}{0}{-1}
	    </me>
	    and determine whether they form a basis for
	    <m>\real^3</m>.
	    <sage>
	      <input>
	      </input>
	    </sage>
	    </p></li>

	    <li><p> Do the vectors
	    <me>
	      \vvec_1 = \threevec{-2}{1}{3},
	      \vvec_2 = \threevec{3}{0}{-1},
	      \vvec_3 = \threevec{1}{1}{0},
	      \vvec_4 = \threevec{0}{3}{-2}
	    </me>
	    form a basis for <m>\real^3</m>?  </p></li>

	    <li><p> Explain why the vectors
	    <m>\evec_1,\evec_2,\evec_3</m> form a basis for

	    <li><p> If a set of vectors

	    positions of the matrix
	    <me>
	      \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	      \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \ldots \amp \vvec_n
	      \end{array}\right]

	    </p></li>

	    <li><p> If the set of vectors
	    <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is a basis 
	    for <m>\real^{10}</m>, how many vectors must be in the set?
	    </p></li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
	<p><ol marker="a.">
	  <li><p> The matrix <m>\left[\begin{array}{rr} \vvec_1 \amp
	  \vvec_2 \end{array}\right]</m> is row equivalent to the
	  identity matrix so it has a pivot position in every row.
	  The span of the columns is therefore <m>\real^2</m>.  There
	  is also a pivot position in every column, which means that
	  the columns are linearly independent.  </p></li>

	  <li><p> We note that
	  <me>
	    \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	    1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	    1 \amp -1 \amp -1
	    \end{array}\right]
	    \sim
	    \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp 1
	    \end{array}\right]\text{.}
	  </me>
	  Since there is a pivot position in every row, the span of
	  the vectors is <m>\real^3</m>.  Since there is a pivot
	  position in every column, the vectors are linearly
	  independent.  Consequently, this set of vectors forms a
	  basis for <m>\real^3</m>.  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The matrix whose columns are the
	  vectors <m>\vvec_1</m>, <m>\vvec_2</m>, <m>\vvec_3</m>, and
	  <m>\vvec_4</m> has dimensions <m>3\times4</m>.
	  Therefore, there cannot be a pivot position in every column,
	  which tells us that the columns cannot be linearly
	  independent.  Therefore, the set of vectors do not form a
	  basis for <m>\real^3</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> Putting these vectors into a matrix produces the
	  identity matrix, which has a pivot position in every row and
	  every column.  Therefore, the span of the vectors is
	  <m>\real^3</m>, and they are linearly independent.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> There must be a pivot position in every row and
	  every column.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> A basis for <m>\real^{10}</m> must have <m>10</m>
	  vectors.  Because the associated matrix must have a pivot
	  position in every row and every column, there must be the
	  same number of columns as there are rows.  Since the vectors
	  are <m>10</m>-dimensional, there must be 10 vectors.
	  </p></li>
	</ol></p>
      </solution>
	    
    </activity>
	
    <p> We can develop a test to determine if a set of vectors
    <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> forms a
    basis for <m>\real^m</m> by considering the matrix
    <me>
      A = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
      \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \ldots \amp \vvec_n
      \end{array}\right]
    </me>.
    To be a basis, this set of vectors must span <m>\real^m</m> and be
    linearly independent.
    </p>

    <p> We know that the span of the set of vectors is
    <m>\real^m</m> if and only if <m>A</m> has a pivot position in every
    row.  We also know that the set of vectors is linearly
    independent if and only if <m>A</m> has a pivot position in every
    column.  This means that a set of vectors forms a basis if and
    only if <m>A</m> has a pivot in every row and every column.
    Therefore, <m>A</m> must be row equivalent to the identity matrix
    <m>I</m>: 
    <me>
      A \sim \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
      1 \amp 0 \amp \cdots \amp 0 \\
      0 \amp 1 \amp \cdots \amp 0 \\
      \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \ddots \amp \vdots \\
      0 \amp 0 \amp \cdots \amp 1
      \end{array}\right] = I
    </me>.
    </p>

    <p> In addition to helping identify bases, this fact tells us
    something important about the number of vectors in a basis.  Since
    the matrix <m>A</m> has a pivot position in every row and every
    column, it must have the same number of rows as columns.
    Therefore, the number of vectors in a basis for <m>\real^m</m>
    must be <m>m</m>.  For example, a basis for <m>\real^{23}</m> must
    have exactly 23 vectors.
    </p>

    <proposition>
      <statement>
	<p> A set of vectors forms a basis for <m>\real^m</m> if and
	only if the matrix 
	<me>
	  A = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	  \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \cdots \amp \vvec_n
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \sim I.
	</me>
	This means there must be <m>m</m> vectors in a basis for
	<m>\real^m</m>. </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> Notice that the vectors 
	<me>
	  \evec_1 = \threevec{1}{0}{0},
	  \evec_2 = \threevec{0}{1}{0},
	  \evec_3 = \threevec{0}{0}{1}
	</me>
	form the columns of the
	<m>3\times3</m> identity matrix, which implies that this set
	forms a basis for <m>\real^3</m>.
	More generally, the set of vectors
	<m>\evec_1,\evec_2,\ldots,\evec_m</m> forms a basis for
	<m>\real^m</m>, which we call the <em>standard</em>
	basis for <m>\real^m</m>.

    <title> Coordinate systems </title>

    <p> A basis for <m>\real^m</m> forms a coordinate system for
    <m>\real^m</m>, as we will describe.  Rather than continuing to
    write a list of vectors, we will find it convenient to denote a
    basis using a single symbol, such as
    <me>
      \bcal = \{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_m\}
    </me>
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  In this section's preview activity, we considered the
	  vectors
	  <me>
	    \vvec_1 = \twovec{2}{1},
	    \vvec_2 = \twovec{1}{2}
	  </me>,
	  which form a basis <m>\bcal=\{\vvec_1,\vvec_2\}</m> for
	  <m>\real^2</m>.  
	</p>

	<sidebyside widths="45% 45%">
	  <p> In the standard coordinate system, the point <m>(2,-3)</m>
	  is found by moving 2 units to the right and 3 units down.  We
	  would like to define a new coordinate system where we interpret
	  <m>(2,-3)</m> to mean we move two times along <m>\vvec_1</m> and
	  3 times along <m>-\vvec_2</m>.  As we see in the figure,
	  doing so leaves us at the point <m>(1,-4)</m>, expressed in
	  the usual coordinate system.

                <p>There is a set of coordinate axes and a standard
                <m>1\times1</m> coordinate grid in the background.
                There are also two vectors <m>\vvec_1=\twovec21</m>
                and <m>\vvec_2=\twovec12</m> and two sets of parallel
                lines representing the linear combinations of
                <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  One set of
                parallel lines is parallel to <m>\vvec_1</m> and

                passes through integer multiples of

              </description>
            </image>
	</sidebyside>

	<p> We have seen that
	<me>
	  \xvec = \twovec{1}{-4} = 2\vvec_1 - 3\vvec_2 </me>.  The
	  coordinates of the vector <m>\xvec</m> in the new coordinate
	  system are the weights that we use to create <m>\xvec</m> as
	  a linear combination of <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.
	</p>

	<p> Since we now have two descriptions of the vector <m>\xvec</m>,
	we need some notation to keep track of
	which coordinate system we are 
	using.  Because <m>\twovec{1}{-4} = 2\vvec_1 - 3\vvec_2</m>, we
	will write 
	<me>
	  \coords{\twovec{1}{-4}}{\bcal} =
	  \twovec{2}{-3} 
	</me>.
	More generally, <m>\coords{\xvec}{\bcal}</m> will denote the
	coordinates of <m>\xvec</m> in the basis <m>\bcal</m>;  that
	is, <m>\coords{\xvec}{\bcal}</m> is the vector
	<m>\twovec{c_1}{c_2}</m> of weights such that
	<me>
	  \xvec = c_1\vvec_1 + c_2 \vvec_2
	</me>.
	</p>

	<p> For example, if the coordinates of <m>\xvec</m> in the
	basis <m>\bcal</m> are
	<me>
	  \coords{\xvec}{\bcal} = \twovec{5}{-2}
	</me>,
	then
	<me>
	  \xvec = 5\vvec_1 - 2\vvec_2 = 5\twovec{2}{1}-2\twovec{1}{2}
	  = \twovec{8}{3},
	</me>
	and we conclude that
	<me>
	  \coords{\twovec{8}{3}}{\bcal} = \twovec{5}{-2}
	</me>.
	This demonstrates how we can translate coordinates in the
	basis <m>\bcal</m> into standard coordinates.
	</p>

	<p> Suppose we know the expression of a vector <m>\xvec</m> in

	  \coords{\twovec{-8}{2}}{\bcal}=\twovec{c_1}{c_2},

    <p> This example illustrates how a basis in <m>\real^2</m>
    provides a new coordinate system for <m>\real^2</m> and shows how
    we may translate between this coordinate system and the standard
    one. </p>

    <p> More generally, suppose that
    <m>\bcal=\{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_m\}</m> is a basis for
    <m>\real^m</m>.  We know that the span of the vectors is
    <m>\real^m</m>, which implies that any vector <m>\xvec</m> in
    <m>\real^m</m> can be written as a linear combination of the
    vectors.  In addition, we know that the vectors are linearly
    independent, which means that we can write <m>\xvec</m> as a
    linear combination of the vectors in exactly one way.  Therefore,
    we have
    <me>
      \xvec = c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2 + \ldots + c_m\vvec_m
    </me>
    where the weights <m>c_1, c_2,\ldots, c_m</m> are unique.  In this
    case, we write the coordinate description of <m>\xvec</m> in the
    basis <m>\bcal</m> as
    <me>
      \coords{\xvec}{\bcal} = \cfourvec{c_1}{c_2}{\vdots}{c_m}

    <p> This activity demonstrates how we can efficiently convert
    between coordinate systems defined by different bases.  Let's
    consider a basis <m>\bcal = \{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_m\}</m>
    and a vector <m>\xvec</m>.  We know that
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      \xvec \amp {}={} c_1\vvec_1 +c_2\vvec_2+\ldots+c_m\vvec_m \\
      \\
      \amp {}={}

      \amp {}={}
      \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}

      \end{array}\right]
      \coords{\xvec}{\bcal}\text{.}
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    If we use <m>P_{\bcal}</m> to denote the matrix whose columns are
    the basis vectors, then we find that
    <me>
      \xvec = P_{\bcal}\coords{\xvec}{\bcal}
    </me>
    where <m>P_{\bcal} = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
    \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \cdots \amp \vvec_m
    \end{array}\right]</m>.  This means that the matrix
    <m>P_{\bcal}</m> converts coordinates in the basis <m>\bcal</m>
    into standard coordinates.</p>

    <p> Since the columns of <m>P_{\bcal}</m> are the basis vectors
    <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_m</m>, we know that <m>P_{\bcal}
    \sim I_m</m>, and <m>P_{\bcal}</m> is therefore invertible.
    Since we have
    <me>
      \xvec = P_{\bcal}\coords{\xvec}{\bcal}
    </me>,
    we must also have
    <me>
      P_{\bcal}^{-1}\xvec = \coords{\xvec}{\bcal}
    </me>.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="proposition-coordinate-transform">

    </proposition>

    <p> If we have another basis <m>\ccal</m>, we find, in the same
    way, that <m>\xvec = P_{\ccal}\coords{\xvec}{\ccal}</m> for the
    conversion between coordinates in the basis <m>\ccal</m> into
    standard coordinates.  We then have

    = (P_{\bcal}^{-1}P_{\ccal}) \coords{\xvec}{\ccal}
    </me>.
    Therefore, <m>P_{\bcal}^{-1}P_{\ccal}</m> is the matrix that

    <title> Examples of bases </title>

    <p> We will now look at some examples of bases that illustrate how
    it can be useful to study a problem using a different coordinate
    system. 
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> Let's consider the basis of <m>\real^3</m>:
	<me>
	  \bcal = \left\{
	  \threevec{1}{0}{-2},
	  \threevec{-2}{1}{0},
	  \threevec{1}{1}{2}
	  \right\}.
	</me>
	It is relatively straightforward to convert a vector's
	representation in this basis into to the standard basis using
	the matrix whose columns are the basis vectors:
	<me>
	  P_{\bcal} =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp -2 \amp 1 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\
	  -2 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\
	  \end{array}\right].
	</me>
	For example, suppose that the vector <m>\xvec</m> is described
	in the coordinate system defined by the basis as
	<m>\coords{\xvec}{\bcal} = \threevec{2}{-2}{1}</m>.  We then
	have
	<me>
	  \xvec = P_{\bcal}\coords{\xvec}{\bcal} =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp -2 \amp 1 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\
	  -2 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \threevec{2}{-2}{1}
	  =
	  \threevec{7}{-1}{-2}
	</me>.
	</p>

	<p> Consider now the vector <m>\xvec=\threevec{3}{1}{-2}</m>.
	If we would like to express <m>\xvec</m> in the coordinate
	system defined by <m>\bcal</m>, then we compute
	<me>
	  \coords{\xvec}{\bcal} = P^{-1}_{\bcal}\xvec
	  =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  \frac14 \amp \frac 12 \amp -\frac38 \\
	  -\frac14 \amp \frac12 \amp -\frac18 \\
	  \frac14 \amp \frac12 \amp \frac18 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \threevec{3}{1}{-2}
	  =
	  \threevec{2}{0}{1}
	</me>.

	<p>
	  To convert our revenue vectors into the

	    P_{\bcal} =

	  In particular, if the revenue vector is <m>\xvec =

	  Notice that the first component of

      <title> Edge detection </title>

      <statement>
      <p> An important problem in the field of computer vision is to
      detect edges in a digital photograph, as is shown in <xref
      ref="fig-edge-detection" />.  Edge detection algorithms are
      useful when, say, we want a robot to locate an object in its
      field of view.  Graphic designers also use these algorithms to
      create artistic effects.

      <p> We will consider a very simple version of an edge detection
      algorithm to give a sense of how this works.  Rather than
      considering a two-dimensional photograph, we will think about a
      one-dimensional row of pixels in a photograph.  The grayscale
      values of a pixel measure the brightness of a pixel;  a
      grayscale value of 0 corresponds to black, and a value of 255
      corresponds to white.
      </p>

      <p> Suppose, for simplicity, that the grayscale values for a row
      of six pixels are represented by a vector <m>\xvec</m> in
      <m>\real^6</m>: 
      </p>

            first four grayscale values are relatively small, but the
