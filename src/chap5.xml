  <title> Linear algebra and computing </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Our principal tool for finding solutions to linear
    systems has been Gaussian elimination, which we first met back
    in <xref ref="sec-finding-solutions" />.  When presented with a
    linear system, we frequently find the reduced row echelon form of
    the system's augmented matrix to read off the solution. </p>

    <p> While this is a convenient approach for learning linear
    algebra, people rarely use the reduced row echelon form of a
    matrix.  In fact, many linear algebra software packages do not
    include functions for finding the reduced row echelon form.  In
    this chapter, we will describe why this is the case and then
    explore some alternatives.  The intent of this chapter is to
    demonstrate how linear algebraic computations are handled in
    practice.  More specifically, we will improve our techniques for
    solving linear systems and for finding eigenvectors through
    Gaussian elimination. </p>
