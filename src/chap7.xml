    Singular value decompositions
  </title> 

  <introduction>
    <p>
      <xref ref="chap4" /> demonstrated several important uses for the
      theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  For example,
      knowing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix <m>A</m>
      enabled us to make predictions about the long-term behavior of
      dynamical systems in which some initial state <m>\xvec_0</m>
      evolves according to the rule <m>\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can't, however, apply this theory to every problem we might
      meet.  First, eigenvectors only exist when the matrix <m>A</m>
      is square, and we have seen situations, such as the
      least-squares problems in <xref ref="sec-least-squares" />, where the
      matrices we're interested in are not square.  Second, even when
      <m>A</m> is square, there may not be a basis for <m>\real^m</m>
      consisting of eigenvectors of <m>A</m>, an important condition
      we required for some of our work.

      This chapter introduces singular value decompositions, whose
      singular values and singular vectors may be viewed as a
      generalization of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  In fact, we
      will see that every matrix, whether square or not, has a
      singular value decomposition and that knowing it gives us a
      great deal of insight into the matrix.  It's been said that
      having a singular value decomposition is like looking at a
      matrix with X-ray vision as the decomposition reveals essential
      features of the matrix.
