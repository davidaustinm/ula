  <title> Image compression </title>

  <introduction>

    <p> Digital images, such as the photographs taken on your phone,
    are 
    displayed as a rectangular array of pixels.  For example, the
    photograph in <xref ref="fig-jpeg-orig" /> is 1440 pixels wide and
    1468 pixels high.  If we were to zoom in on the photograph, we
    would be able to see individual pixels, such as those shown on the
    right.

            a region occupied by the canyon wall.  The colors of
            the 64 pixels do not change much.  Each of them is a
            fairly constant orange with small changes in the
            brightness.</p>

    <p> A lot of data is required to display this image.  A quantity
    of digital data is frequently measured in bytes,
    where one byte is the amount of storage needed to record an
    integer between 0 and 255.  As we will see shortly, each pixel
    requires three bytes to record that pixel's color.  This means the
    amount of data required to display this image is
    <m>3\times1440\times1468 = 6,341,760</m> bytes or about 6.3
    megabytes.
    </p>

    <p> Of course, we would like to store this image on a phone or
    computer and perhaps transmit it through our data plan to
    share it with others.  If possible, we would like to find a
    way to represent this image using a smaller amount of data
    so that we don't run out of memory on our phone and quickly
    exhaust our data plan.
    </p>

    <p> As we will see in this section, the JPEG compression
    algorithm provides a means for doing just that.  This image, when
    stored in the JPEG format, requires only 467,359 bytes of data,
    which is about 7% of the 6.3 megabytes required to display the
    image.  That is, when we display this image, we are reconstructing
    it from only 7% of the original data.  This isn't too surprising
    since there is quite a bit of redundancy in the image; the left
    half of the image is almost uniformly blue.  The JPEG algorithm
    detects this redundancy by representing the data using 
    bases that are well-suited to the task.

  <subsection>
    <title> Color models </title>

    <p> A color is represented digitally by a vector in
    <m>\real^3</m>.  There are different ways in which we can
    represent colors, however, depending on whether a computer or a
    human will be processing the color.  We will describe two of these
    representations, called <em>color models</em>, and demonstrate how
    they are used in the JPEG compression algorithm.
    </p>

    <p> Digital displays typically create colors by blending together
    various amounts of red, green, and blue.  We can therefore
    describe a color by putting its constituent amounts of red, green,
    and blue into a vector <m>\threevec{R}{G}{B}</m>.  The quantities
    <m>R</m>, <m>G</m>, and <m>B</m> are each stored with one byte of
    information so they are integers between 0 and 255.  This
    is called the <m>RGB</m> color model.
    <idx> <m>RGB</m> color model </idx>
    </p>

    <p> We define a basis <m>\bcal=\{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_3\}</m>
    where
    <me>
      \vvec_1 =\left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right],~~~
      \vvec_2 =\left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ -0.34413 \\ 1.77200
      \end{array}\right],~~~
      \vvec_3 =\left[\begin{array}{c} 1.40200 \\ -0.71414 \\
      0 \end{array}\right]
    </me>
    to define a new coordinate system with coordinates we denote
    <m>Y</m>, <m>C_b</m>, and <m>C_r</m>:
    <me>
      \coords{\threevec{R}{G}{B}}{\bcal} = \threevec{Y}{C_b}{C_r}
    </me>.
    <idx> luminance </idx>
    <idx> chrominance </idx>
    The coordinate <m>Y</m> is called <em>luminance</em> while
    <m>C_b</m> and <m>C_r</m> are called blue and red
    <em>chrominance</em>, respectively.  In this coordinate system,
    luminance will vary from 0 to 255, while the chrominances vary
    between -127.5 and 127.5.  This is known as the <m>YC_bC_r</m> color
    model.  (To be completely accurate, we should add 127.5 to the
    chrominance values so that they lie between 0 and 255, but we
    won't worry about that here.)
    <idx> <m>YC_bC_r</m> color model </idx>
    </p>

    <activity>

      <p> This activity investigates these two color models, which we
      view as coordinate systems for 
      describing colors.

    <p> These two color models provide us with two ways to represent
    colors, each of which is useful in a certain context.  Digital
    displays, such as those in phones and computer monitors, create
    colors by combining various amounts of red, green, and blue.
    The <m>RGB</m> model is therefore most relevant in digital
    applications.
    </p>

    <p> By contrast, the <m>YC_bC_r</m> color model was created based on
    research into human vision and aims to concentrate the most visually
    important data into a single coordinate, the luminance, to which our
    eyes are most sensitive.  Of course, any basis of <m>\real^3</m>
    must have three vectors so we need two more coordinates, blue
    and red chrominance, if we want to represent all colors.
    </p>

    <p> To see this explicitly, shown in <xref
    ref="fig-jpeg-luminance" /> is the original image and the image as
    rendered with only the luminance.  That is, on the right, the
    color of each pixel is represented by only one byte, which is the
    luminance. This image essentially looks like a grayscale version
    of the original image with all its visual detail.  In fact, before
    digital television became the standard, television signals were
    broadcast using the <m>YC_bC_r</m> color model.  When a signal was
    displayed on a black-and-white television, the luminance was
    displayed and the two chrominance values simply ignored.

    <p> The aim of the JPEG compression algorithm is to represent an
    image using the smallest amount of data possible.  By converting
    from the <m>RGB</m> color model to the <m>YC_bC_r</m> color model,
    we are concentrating the most visually important data into 
    the luminance values.  This is helpful because we can
    safely ignore some of the data in the chrominance values since
    that data is not as visually important.

    <p> The key to representing the image using a smaller amount of
    data is to detect redundancies in the data.  To begin, we
    first break the image, which is composed of <m>1440\times 1468</m>
    pixels, into small <m>8\times8</m> blocks of pixels.  For example,
    we will consider the <m>8\times8</m> block of pixels outlined in

            <p>The numerical values for the luminance in the eight by
            eight block of pixels.  In general, luminance values lie
            between 0 and 255.  The values in this block show
            relatively little variation.  Most values are between 150

    </figure>

    <p> Our strategy in the compression algorithm is to perform a
    change of basis to take advantage of the fact that the luminance
    values do not change significantly over the block.  Rather than
    recording the luminance of each of the pixels, this change of basis
    will allow us to record the average luminance along with some
    information about how the individual colors vary from the average.
    </p>

    <p> Let's look at the first column of luminance values, which is a
    vector in <m>\real^8</m>:
    <me>\xvec = \left[\begin{array}{c}
    176 \\ 181 \\ 165 \\ \vdots \\ 150 \\
    \end{array}\right]
    </me>.
    We will perform a change of basis and describe this
    vector by the average of the luminance values and
    information about variations from the average.

    a little more rapidly, and <m>\vvec_7</m> varies quite rapidly.
    The main thing to notice is that:  the basis vectors vary at

    <p> If we were to look inside a JPEG image file, we would see lots
    of matrices like this.  For each <m>8\times 8</m> block, there
    would be three matrices of Fourier coefficients of the rows of
    Fourier coefficients, one matrix for each of the luminance, blue
    chrominance, and red chrominance values.  However, we store these
    Fourier coefficients as integers inside the JPEG file so we need
    to round off the coefficients to the nearest integer, as shown here:
    <me>\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
    161 \amp -4 \amp -5 \amp -2 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 0  \\
3 \amp 15 \amp 4 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
4 \amp 7 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
-2 \amp -4 \amp -2 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 0  \\
-1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
-1 \amp -2 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
0 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 1  \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
\end{array}\right]
</me>.
</p>
<p>
  There are many zeroes in this matrix, and 
  we can save space in a JPEG image file by only
  recording the <em>nonzero</em> Fourier coefficients.
    </p>

    <p> In fact, when a JPEG file is created, there is a <q>quality</q>
    parameter that can be set, such as that shown in <xref
    ref="fig-jpeg-quality" />.  When the quality parameter is high, we
    will store many of the Fourier coefficients; when it is low, we
    will ignore more of them.

    relatively high.  After 
    rounding off the Fourier coefficients, we will set all of the
    coefficients whose absolute value is less than 2 to zero, which
    creates the matrix: <me>\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr} 161 \amp -4
    \amp -5 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 3 \amp 15 \amp 4
    \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 4 \amp 7 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp
    0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ -2 \amp -4 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
    \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp
    0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp
    0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 0 \amp 0
    \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\ \end{array}\right]. </me>
    Notice that there are 12 nonzero Fourier coefficients, out of 64, that we
    need to record.  Consequently, we only save <m>12/64 \approx
    19\%</m> of the data.
    </p>

    <p> If instead, the quality setting is relatively low, we set all
    of the Fourier coefficients whose absolute value is less than 4 to
    zero, creating the matrix:
<me>\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
161 \amp -4 \amp -5 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
0 \amp 15 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
0 \amp 7 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0  \\
\end{array}\right]
</me>. Notice that there are only 5 nonzero Fourier coefficients that
we need to record now, meaning we save only <m>5/64\approx 8\%</m>
of the data.  This will result in a smaller JPEG file describing the
image.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a lower quality setting, we have thrown
      away more information about the Fourier coefficients so the image will
      not be reconstructed as accurately.
      To see this, we can reconstruct the luminance values from the
      Fourier coefficients by converting back into the standard
      coordinate system.  Rather than showing the luminance values
      themselves, we will show the difference in the original luminance
      values and the reconstructed luminance values.  When the quality
      setting was high and we stored 12 Fourier coefficients, we find
      this difference to be
      <me>\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
      -7 \amp -7 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp -2 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp -1  \\
      4 \amp 4 \amp 4 \amp -1 \amp -3 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp -3  \\
      1 \amp 3 \amp 0 \amp -7 \amp -3 \amp 1 \amp 3 \amp 3  \\
      -7 \amp -3 \amp 3 \amp 1 \amp -5 \amp -2 \amp 1 \amp 2  \\
      0 \amp -3 \amp 4 \amp 4 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp -2  \\
      2 \amp -5 \amp 3 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp 1  \\
      1 \amp -2 \amp 4 \amp 3 \amp -4 \amp -6 \amp -2 \amp 3  \\
      0 \amp -1 \amp 2 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp -4 \amp -1 \amp 5  \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </me>.
      When the quality setting is lower and we store only 5 Fourier
      coefficients, the difference is
      <me>\left[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}
      3 \amp -3 \amp -2 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 7 \amp 10 \amp 10  \\
      14 \amp 11 \amp 6 \amp -1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 4  \\
      7 \amp 10 \amp 5 \amp -5 \amp -3 \amp -1 \amp 2 \amp 3  \\
      -10 \amp -3 \amp 5 \amp 2 \amp -8 \amp -7 \amp -3 \amp -1  \\
      -12 \amp -11 \amp 2 \amp 2 \amp -5 \amp -7 \amp -6 \amp -6  \\
      -11 \amp -15 \amp -2 \amp -2 \amp -2 \amp -4 \amp -5 \amp -2  \\
      -3 \amp -6 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp -2 \amp -5 \amp -4 \amp -1  \\
      6 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 4 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 0  \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p> This demonstrates the trade off.  With a high quality setting,
    we require more storage to save more of the data, but the
    reconstructed image is closer to the original.  With the lower
    quality setting, we require less storage, but the reconstructed
    image differs more from the original.
    </p>

    <p> If we remember that the visual information stored by the blue
    and red chrominance values is not as important as that contained
    in the luminance values, we feel safer in discarding more of the
    Fourier coefficients for the chrominance values resulting in an even
    greater savings.

    <p> This discussion of the JPEG compression algorithm is meant to
    explore the ideas that underlie its construction and demonstrate
    the importance of a choice of basis and its
    accompanying coordinate system.  There are a few
    details, most notably about the rounding of the Fourier
    coefficients, that are not strictly accurate.  The actual
    implementation is a little more complicated, but the presentation
    here conveys the spirit of the algorithm.
    </p>

    <p> The JPEG compression algorithm allows
    us to store image files using only a fraction of the data.
    Similar ideas are used to efficiently store digital music and
    video files.

    <title> Summary </title>

    <p> This section has explored how appropriate changes in bases
    help us reconstruct an image using only a fraction of its data.
    This is known as image compression.
    <ul>
      <li><p>  There are several ways of representing colors, all of
      which use vectors in <m>\real^3</m>.  We explored the <m>RGB</m>
      color model, which is appropriate in digital applications, and
      the <m>YC_bC_r</m> model, in which the most important visual
      information is conveyed by the <m>Y</m> component, known as
      luminance. </p></li>

      <li><p> We also explored a change of basis called the Discrete
      Fourier Transform.  In the coordinate system that results, the
      first coefficient measures the average of the components of a
      vector.  Other coefficients measure variations in the components
      away from the average.  </p></li>

      <li><p> We put both of these ideas to use in demonstrating the
      JPEG compression algorithm.  An image is broken into
      <m>8\times8</m> blocks, and the colors into luminance, blue
      chrominance, and red chrominance.  Applying the Discrete Fourier
      Transform allows us to reconstruct a good
      approximation of the image using only a fraction of the original
      data. </p></li>
