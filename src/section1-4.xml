  <title>
    Pivots and their influence on solution spaces
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> By now, we have seen several examples illustrating how the
    reduced row echelon matrix leads to a convenient description of
    the solution space to a linear system.  In this
    section, we will use this understanding to make some general
    observations about how certain features of the reduced row echelon
    matrix reflect the nature of the solution space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember that a leading entry in a reduced row echelon matrix is
      the leftmost nonzero entry in a row of the matrix.  As we'll
      see, the positions of these leading entries encode a lot of
      information about the solution space of the corresponding linear
      system.  For this reason, we make the following definition.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <idx> pivot position </idx>
      <p> A <term> pivot position </term> in a matrix <m>A</m> is the
      position of a leading entry in the reduced row echelon matrix of
      <m>A</m>.  
      </p>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For instance, in this reduced row echelon matrix, the pivot
      positions are indicated in bold:
      <me>
	\begin{bmatrix}
	{\mathbf 1} \amp \gray{0} \amp \gray{*} \amp \gray{0} \\
	\gray{0} \amp {\mathbf 1} \amp \gray{*} \amp \gray{0} \\
	\gray{0} \amp \gray{0} \amp \gray{0} \amp {\mathbf 1} \\
	\gray{0} \amp \gray{0} \amp \gray{0} \amp \gray{0} \\
	\end{bmatrix}.
      </me>
      We can refer to pivot positions by their row and column number
      saying, for instance, that there is a pivot position in the
      third row and fourth column.
    </p>

    <p> When we have looked at solution spaces of linear systems,
    we have frequently asked whether there are infinitely
    many solutions, exactly one solution, or no solutions.  We will
    now break this question into two separate questions.
    </p>

    <question xml:id="fundamental-questions">
      <title> Two Fundamental Questions </title>
      <p>
	When we
	encounter a linear system, we often ask
	<dl>
	  <li> <title> Existence </title>
	  <p> Is there a solution to the linear system?  If
	  so, we say that the system is <em> consistent </em>; if not,
	  we say it is <em> inconsistent</em>.
	  <idx> consistent system </idx>
	  <idx> inconsistent system </idx>
	  </p>
	  </li>
	  
	  <li> <title> Uniqueness </title>
	  <p> If the linear system is consistent, is the solution
	  unique or are there infinitely many solutions?
	  </p>
	  </li>
	</dl>
      </p>
    </question>

    <p> These two questions represent two sides of a coin that appear
    in many variations throughout our explorations.  In this section, we
    will study how the location of the pivots influence the answers to
    these two questions.  We begin by considering the first question
    concerning the existence of solutions.

	      The first two augmented matrices correspond to

	      In the coefficient matrix, there is a row without a

    <p>
      Let's summarize the results of this activity by considering the
      following reduced row echelon matrix:
      <me>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{rrr|r}
	1 \amp * \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	\end{array}
	\right]
	</me>.
      In terms of variables <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>,
      the final equation says
      <me>
	0x + 0y + 0z = 0
	</me>.
	If we evaluate the left-hand side with any values of <m>x</m>,
	<m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>, we get 0, which means that the
	equation always holds.  Therefore, its presence has no
	effect on the solution space defined by the other three
	equations.
    </p>

    <p> The third equation, however, says that <me> 0x + 0y + 0z = 1
    </me>.  Again, if we evaluate the left-hand side with any values
    of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>, we get 0 so this equation 
    cannot be satisfied for any <m>(x,y,z)</m>.  This means that the
    entire linear 
    system has no solution and is therefore inconsistent.
    </p>

    <p>
      An equation like this appears in the reduced row echelon matrix
      as
      <me>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{cccc|c}
	\vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp \cdots \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	\vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \amp \vdots \\
	\end{array}
	\right]
	</me>.
	The pivot positions make this condition clear:
	<em>the system is inconsistent if there is a pivot position in
	the 
	rightmost column of the corresponding augmented matrix.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, we will soon see that the system is consistent if there
      is not a pivot in the rightmost column of the corresponding
      augmented matrix.  This leaves us with the following
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="thm-pivot-inconsistency">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  A linear system is inconsistent if and only if
	  there is a pivot position in the rightmost column of the

    <p>
      This also says something about the pivot positions of the
      coefficient matrix.  Consider an example of an inconsistent
      system corresponding to the 
      reduced row echelon form of the following augmented matrix
      <me>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{ccc|c}
	1 \amp 0 \amp * \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 1 \amp * \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}
	\right]
	</me>. The
	<xref ref="principle-augmentation-principle" text="custom">
	  Augmentation Principle
	</xref> says that 
	that the reduced row echelon form of the
	coefficient matrix is
      <me>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{ccc}
	1 \amp 0 \amp * \\
	0 \amp 1 \amp * \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	\end{array}
	\right],
      </me>
      which shows that the coefficient matrix has a row without a
      pivot position.  To turn this around, we see that <em> if every row
      of the coefficient matrix has a pivot position, then the system
      must be consistent. </em> For instance, if our linear system 
      has a coefficient matrix whose reduced row echelon
      form is
      <me>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{ccc}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}
	\right]
	</me>,
	then we can guarantee that the linear system is
	consistent because there is no way to obtain a pivot in the
	rightmost column of the augmented matrix.
    </p>

    <proposition>
      <statement>
	If every row of the coefficient matrix has a pivot position,
	then the corresponding system of linear equations is
	consistent.

	      The third linear system is inconsistent.  The first

	      In this case, the variable <m>x_4</m> is free meaning

	    </p></li>

	    <li><p>
	      If the coefficient matrix has a

    <p>
      Let's consider what we've learned in this activity.  Since we are
      interested in the question of whether a consistent linear system
      has a unique solution or infinitely many, we will only consider
      consistent systems.  By the results of the previous section,
      this means that there is not a pivot in the rightmost column of
      the augmented matrix.  Here are two possible examples:
      <sidebyside>
	<p>
	  <me>
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rrr|r}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 4 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \\
	    \end{array}
	    \right]
	  </me>
	</p>

	<p>
	  <me>
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rrr|r}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp -2 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	    \end{array}
	    \right]
	  </me>
	</p>
	
      </sidebyside>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the first example, we have the equations
      <me>
	\begin{alignedat}{4}
	x_1 \amp {}={} \amp 4 \\
	x_2 \amp {}={} \amp -1 \\
	x_3 \amp {}={} \amp 2 \\
	\end{alignedat}
      </me>
      demonstrating the fact that there is a unique solution
      <m>(x_1,x_2,x_3) = (4,-1,2)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the second example, we have the equations
      <me>
	\begin{alignedat}{4}
	x_1 \amp \amp \amp {}+{} \amp 2x_3\amp {}={} \amp -2 \\
	\amp \amp x_2 \amp {}+{} \amp x_3\amp {}={} \amp 4 \\
	\end{alignedat}
      </me>
      that we may rewrite in parametric form as
      <me>
	\begin{alignedat}{4}
	x_1 \amp {}={} \amp -2-2x_3 \\
	x_2 \amp {}={} \amp 4-x_3 \\
	\end{alignedat}
      </me>.
      Here we see that <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are basic
      variables that may be expressed in terms of the free variable
      <m>x_3</m>.  In this case, the presence of the free variable
      leads to infinitely many solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember that every column of the coefficient matrix corresponds
      to a variable in our linear system.  In the first example, we
      see that every column of the coefficient contains a pivot
      position, which means that every variable is uniquely
      determined.  In the second example, the column of the
      coefficient matrix corresponding to <m>x_3</m> does not contain
      a pivot position, which  results in <m>x_3</m> appearing as a free
      variable.  This illustrates the following principle.
    </p>

    <principle>
      <statement>
	<p>Suppose that we consider a consistent linear system.
	<ul>
	  <li><p> If every column of the coefficient matrix contains
	  a pivot position, then the system has a unique solution.
	  </p></li>
	  <li><p>If there
	  is a column in the coefficient matrix that contains no pivot
	  position, then the system has infinitely many solutions.
	  </p></li>
	  <li><p> Columns that contain a pivot position
	  correspond to basic variables while columns that do not
	  correspond to free variables.
	  </p></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
      </statement>
    </principle>

    <p>
      When a linear system has a unique solution, every column of the
      coefficient matrix has a pivot position.  Since every row
      contains at most one pivot position, there must be at least as
      many rows as columns in the coefficient matrix.  Therefore, the
      linear system has at least as many equations as variables, which
      is something we intuitively suspected in <xref ref="sec-expect" />.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is reasonable to ask how we choose the free variables.  For
      instance, if we have a single equation
      <me>
	x + 2y = 4
      </me>,
      then we may write
      <me>
	x = 4-2y
      </me>
      or, equivalently,
      <me>
	y = 2 - \frac12 x
      </me>.
      Clearly, either variable may be considered as a free variable in
      this case.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we'll see in the future, we are more interested in the
      <em>number</em> of free variables rather than in their choice.
      For convenience, we will adopt the convention that free
      variables correspond to columns without a pivot
      position, which allows us to quickly identify them.  For
      example, the variables <m>x_2</m> and <m>x_4</m> appear as
      free variables in the following linear system:
      <me>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{rrrr|r}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \amp 0 \\
	\end{array}
	\right]
      </me>.
    </p>

    <title> Summary </title>

    <p> We have seen how the locations of pivot positions, in both the
    augmented and coefficient matrices, give vital information about
    the existence and uniqueness of solutions to linear systems.  More
    specifically,
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
	<li> <p> A linear system is inconsistent exactly when a
	pivot position appears in the rightmost column of the
	<em>augmented</em> matrix. </p></li>

	<li> <p> If a linear system is consistent, the solution is
	unique when every column of the <em>coefficient</em> matrix
	contains a pivot position.  There are infinitely many solutions
	when there is a column of the <em>coefficient</em> matrix
	without a pivot position.  </p></li>

	<li> <p> If a linear system is consistent, the columns of the
	coefficient matrix containing pivot positions correspond to
	basic variables and the columns without pivot positions
	correspond to free variables. </p></li>
