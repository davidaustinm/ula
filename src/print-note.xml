    <title>A note on the print version</title>

    <p>
      This book aims to develop readers' ability to reason about
      linear algebraic concepts and to apply that reasoning in a
      computational environment.  In particular, Sage is introduced as
      a platform for performing many linear algebraic computations
      since it is freely available and its syntax mirrors common
      mathematical notation.
    </p>

      <!--
      The online version of this book has many embedded Sage cells
      that allow readers to perform computations from within the
      book.
      -->
      Print readers may access Sage online using either
      <url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/">the Sage cell
      server</url> or a provided <url href="https://gvsu.edu/s/0Ng">
      page of Sage cells.</url>
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout the book, Sage cells appear in various places to
      encourage readers to use Sage to complete some relevant
      computation.  In the print version, these may appear with some
      pre-populated code, such as the one below, that you will want to
      copy into an online Sage cell.
      <sage>
	<input>
A = matrix([[1,2], [2,1]])
	</input>
      </sage>
      Empty cells appear as shown below and are included to indicate
      part of an exercise or activity that is meant to be completed in
      Sage. 
      <sage>
	<input>

	</input>
      </sage>
