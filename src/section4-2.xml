  <title> Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> The last section introduced eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
    presented the underlying geometric intuition behind their
    definition, and demonstrated their use in understanding the
    long-term behavior of certain systems.  We will now develop a
    more algebraic understanding of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  In
    particular, we will find an algebraic method for determining the
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix.  </p>

  <subsection>
    <title> The characteristic polynomial </title>

    <p> We will first see that the eigenvalues of a square matrix
    appear as the roots of a particular polynomial.  To begin, notice
    that we originally defined an eigenvector as a nonzero vector
    <m>\vvec</m> that satisfies the equation <m>A\vvec =
    \lambda\vvec</m>.  We will rewrite this as
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      A\vvec \amp {}={} \lambda\vvec \\
      A\vvec - \lambda\vvec \amp {}={} \zerovec \\
      A\vvec - \lambda I\vvec \amp {}={} \zerovec \\
      (A-\lambda I)\vvec \amp {}={} \zerovec\text{.} \\
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    In other words, an eigenvector <m>\vvec</m> is a solution of the
    homogeneous equation <m>(A-\lambda I)\vvec=\zerovec</m>.  This
    puts us in the familiar territory explored in the next
    activity.
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
      <p> The eigenvalues of a square matrix are defined by the
      condition that there be a nonzero solution to the homogeneous
      equation <m>(A-\lambda I)\vvec=\zerovec</m>.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous
	equation <m>(A-\lambda I)\vvec = \zerovec</m>, what can we

	I</m>? </p></li>

	<li><p> If there is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous

	<li><p> Use the determinant you found in the previous part to
	find the eigenvalues <m>\lambda</m> by solving the equation
	<m>\det(A-\lambda I) = 0</m>.  We considered this matrix in

	eigenvalues for <m>A</m> that we found by reasoning
	geometrically there. </p></li>

	<li><p> Consider the matrix

	      <p>
		<m>\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 3= (\lambda-3)(\lambda+1) =

	    <li>
	      <p>
		For this matrix, we have <m>\det(A-\lambda I) =

    </activity>

    <p> This activity demonstrates a technique that enables us to find
    the eigenvalues of a square matrix <m>A</m>.  Since an eigenvalue
    <m>\lambda</m> is a scalar for which the equation <m>(A-\lambda
    I)\vvec = \zerovec</m> has a nonzero solution, it must be the case
    that <m>A-\lambda I</m> is not invertible.  Therefore, its
    determinant is zero.  This gives us the equation
    <me>
      \det(A-\lambda I) = 0
    </me>
    whose solutions are the eigenvalues of <m>A</m>.  This equation is
    called the <em>characteristic equation</em> of <m>A</m>.
    <idx> characteristic equation </idx>
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-eigenvalues-poly">
      <p> If we write the characteristic equation for the matrix
      <m> A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      -4 \amp 4 \\
      -12 \amp 10 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </m>, we see that
      <me>
	\begin{aligned}
	\det(A-\lambda I) \amp {}={} 0 \\
	\\
	\det \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	-4 - \lambda \amp 4 \\
	-12 \amp 10 - \lambda \\
	\end{array}\right] \amp {}={} 0 \\
	\\
	(-4-\lambda)(10-\lambda) + 48 \amp {}={}  0 \\
	\lambda^2-6\lambda + 8 {}={} 0 \\
	(\lambda-4)(\lambda-2) {}={} 0\text{.} \\
	\end{aligned}
      </me>
      This shows us that the eigenvalues are <m>\lambda = 4</m> and
      <m>\lambda=2</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
  
    <p> <idx> characteristic polynomial </idx>
    In general, the expression <m>\det(A-\lambda I)</m> is a
    polynomial in <m>\lambda</m>, which is called the
    <em>characteristic polynomial</em> of <m>A</m>.  If <m>A</m> is an
    <m>n\times n</m> matrix, the degree of the characteristic
    polynomial is <m>n</m>.  For instance, if <m>A</m> is a
    <m>2\times2</m> matrix, then <m>\det(A-\lambda I)</m> is a
    quadratic polynomial; if <m>A</m> is a <m>3\times3</m> matrix,
    then <m>\det(A-\lambda I)</m> is a cubic polynomial. </p>

    <p>
      The matrix in <xref ref="example-eigenvalues-poly"/> has a
      characteristic polynomial with two real and distinct roots.
      This will not always be the case, as demonstrated in the next
      two examples.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
	Consider the matrix
	<m>A=\begin{bmatrix}
	5 \amp -1\\
	4 \amp 1 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	</m>, whose characteristic equation is
	<me>
	  \lambda^2 - 6\lambda + 9 = (\lambda-3)^2 = 0.
	</me>
	In this case, the characteristic polynomial has one real root,
	which means that this matrix has a single real eigenvalue,
	<m>\lambda = 3</m>. 
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p> To find the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix, we remember
      that the
      determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the entries
      on the diagonal.  For instance, the following triangular matrix
      has the characteristic equation
      <me>
	\begin{aligned}
	\det\left(
	\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	4 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
	0 \amp -2 \amp -1 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 3 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	-\lambda I\right) \amp {}={}
	\det
	\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	4-\lambda \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
	0 \amp -2-\lambda \amp -1 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 3-\lambda \\
	\end{array}\right] \\
	\\
	\amp {}={}(4-\lambda)(-2-\lambda)(3-\lambda) = 0\text{,}
	\end{aligned}
      </me>
      showing that the eigenvalues are the diagonal entries <m>\lambda =
      4,-2,3</m>.

    <title> Finding eigenvectors </title>

    <p> Now that we can find the eigenvalues of a square matrix
    <m>A</m> by solving the characteristic equation <m>\det(A-\lambda
    I) = 0</m>, we will turn to the question of finding the
    eigenvectors associated to an eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>. 
    The key, as before, is to note that an eigenvector is a nonzero
    solution to the homogeneous equation <m>(A-\lambda I)\vvec =
    \zerovec</m>.  In other words, the eigenvectors associated to an
    eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> form the null space <m>\nul(A-\lambda
    I)</m>. </p>

    <p> This shows that the eigenvectors associated to an eigenvalue
    form a subspace of <m>\real^n</m>.  We will 
    denote the subspace of eigenvectors of a matrix <m>A</m>
    associated to the eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> by
    <m>E_\lambda</m> and note that
    <me>
      E_\lambda = \nul(A-\lambda I)
    </me>.
    We say that <m>E_\lambda</m> is the <em>eigenspace</em> of
    <m>A</m> associated 
    to the eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>.
    <idx> eigenspace </idx>
    </p>
    
    <activity>
      <statement>
      <p> In this activity, we will find the eigenvectors of a matrix
      as the null space of the matrix <m>A-\lambda I</m>.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> Let's begin with the matrix
	<m>
	  A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  1 \amp 2 \\
	  2 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</m>.  We have seen that <m>\lambda = 3</m> is an eigenvalue.
	Form the matrix <m>A-3I</m> and find a basis for the

	<li><p> Is it possible to form a basis of <m>\real^2</m>

    </activity>

    <p> Once we find an eigenvalue of a matrix <m>A</m>, describing
    the associated eigenspace <m>E_\lambda</m> amounts to the familiar
    task of describing the null space <m>\nul(A-\lambda I)</m>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <p>
	Revisiting the matrix
	<m> A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	-4 \amp 4 \\
	-12 \amp 10 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	</m> from <xref ref="example-eigenvalues-poly"/>, we recall
	that we found eigenvalues <m>\lambda = 4</m> and <m>\lambda =
	2</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Considering the eigenvalue <m>\lambda = 4</m>, we have
	<me>
	  A -4I =
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  -8 \amp 4 \\

	  \sim
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  1 \amp -1/2 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}.
	</me>
	Since the eigenvectors
	<m>\vvec = \twovec{v_1}{v_2}</m> are the solutions of the
	equation <m>(A-4I)\vvec=\zerovec</m>, we see that they
	are determined by the single
	equation <m>v_1-\frac12 v_2 = 0</m> or <m>v_1 =
	\frac12v_2</m>.  Therefore the 
	eigenvectors in <m>E_4</m> have the form

	  \vvec=\twovec{v_1}{v_2} = \ctwovec{\frac12 v_2}{v_2} =
	  v_2\ctwovec{1/2}{1}.
	</me>
	In other words, <m>E_4</m> is a one-dimensional subspace of
	<m>\real^2</m> with basis vector <m>\ctwovec{1/2}{1}</m> or 
	basis vector <m>\twovec12</m>. 
	In the same way, we find that a basis for the eigenspace
	<m>E_2</m> is <m>\twovec23</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
	We note that, for this matrix, it is possible to construct a
	basis of <m>\real^2</m> consisting of eigenvectors, namely,
	<me>
	  \bcal = \left\{\twovec12, \twovec23\right\}.
	</me>
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
	Consider the matrix <m>A=\begin{bmatrix}
	1 \amp 1 \\
	-1 \amp 3 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	</m> whose characteristic equation is
	<me>
	  \det(A-\lambda I) = \lambda^2 - 4\lambda + 4 = (\lambda-2)^2
	  =0.
	</me>
      </p>

      <p>
	There is a single eigenvalue <m>\lambda= 2</m>, and we find
	that
	<me>
	  A - 2\lambda = \begin{bmatrix}
	  -1 \amp 1 \\
	  -1 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}
	  \sim
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  1 \amp -1 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{bmatrix}.
	</me>
	Therefore, the eigenspace <m>E_2 = \nul(A-2I)</m> is
	one-dimensional with a basis vector <m>\twovec11</m>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p>
	If <m>A=\begin{bmatrix}
	-1 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp -1 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	</m>, then
	<me>
	  \det(A - \lambda I) = (\lambda+1)^2 = 0,
	</me>
	which implies that there is a single eigenvalue
	<m>\lambda=-1</m>.  We find that
	<me>
	  A-(-1)I = \begin{bmatrix}
	  0 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{bmatrix},
	</me>
	which says that every two-dimensional vector <m>\vvec</m>
	satisfies <m>(A-(-1)I)\vvec = \zerovec</m>.  Therefore, every
	vector is an eigenvector and so <m>E_{-1} =
	\real^2</m>.  This eigenspace is two-dimensional.
      </p>

      <p>
	We can see this in another way.  The matrix transformation
	defined by <m>A</m> rotates vectors by <m>180^\circ</m>, which
	says that <m>A\xvec = -\xvec</m> for every vector
	<m>\xvec</m>.  In other words, every two-dimensional vector is
	an eigenvector with associated eigenvalue <m>\lambda=-1</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
	
    <p>
      These last two examples illustrate two types of behavior when
      there is a single eigenvalue.  In one case, we are able to
      construct a basis of <m>\real^2</m> using eigenvectors;  in the
      other, we are not.  We will explore this behavior more in the
      next subsection.
    </p>
    
    <assemblage>
      <title> A check on our work </title>

      <p> When finding eigenvalues and their associated
      eigenvectors in this way, we first find eigenvalues
      <m>\lambda</m> by solving the characteristic equation.  If
      <m>\lambda</m> is a solution to the characteristic equation,
      then <m>A-\lambda I</m> is not invertible and, consequently, 
      <m>A-\lambda I</m> must contain a row
      without a pivot position.</p>

      <p> This serves as a check on our work.  If we row reduce
      <m>A-\lambda I</m> and find the identity matrix, then we have
      made an error either in solving the characteristic equation or
      in finding <m>\nul(A-\lambda I)</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title> The characteristic polynomial and the dimension of
    eigenspaces </title> 

    <p> Given a square
    <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, we saw in the previous section
    the value of being able to express any vector in <m>\real^n</m> as
    a linear 
    combination of eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.  For this reason, 
    <xref ref="question-eigen-basis" /> asks 
    when we can construct a basis of <m>\real^n</m> consisting of
    eigenvectors.  We will explore this question more fully now. </p>

    <p> As we saw above, the eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are the solutions
    of the characteristic equation <m>\det(A-\lambda I) = 0</m>.  The
    examples we have considered demonstrate some different types of
    behavior. For instance, we have seen the characteristic equations 
    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <m>(4-\lambda)(-2-\lambda)(3-\lambda) = 0</m>, which has
	  real and distinct roots,
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <m>(2-\lambda)^2 = 0</m>, which has repeated roots, and
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  <m>\lambda^2 +1 = (i-\lambda)(-i-\lambda) = 0</m>, which has
	  complex roots.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>A</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> matrix, then the
      characteristic polynomial is a degree <m>n</m> polynomial, and
      this means that it has <m>n</m> roots.  Therefore, the
      characteristic equation can be written as
      <me>
	\det(A-\lambda I) = (\lambda_1 -
	\lambda)(\lambda_2-\lambda)\ldots(\lambda_n-\lambda) = 0
      </me>
      giving eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1,
      \lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n</m>.  As we have seen, some of the
      eigenvalues may be complex.  Moreover, some of the eigenvalues
      may appear in this list more than once.
      However, we can always write the
      characteristic equation in the form
      <me>
	(\lambda_1-\lambda)^{m_1}
	(\lambda_2-\lambda)^{m_2}
	\ldots
	(\lambda_p-\lambda)^{m_p}
	= 0.
      </me>
      The number of times that
      <m>\lambda_j - \lambda</m> appears as a factor in the
      characteristic polynomial, is called the <em>multiplicity</em>
      of the eigenvalue <m>\lambda_j</m>.
      <idx> multiplicity </idx>
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> We have seen that the matrix
	<m>A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	1 \amp 1 \\
	-1 \amp 3 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	</m> has the characteristic equation <m>(2-\lambda)^2 =
	0</m>.  This matrix has a single eigenvalue
	<m>\lambda = 2</m>, which has multiplicity <m>2</m>. </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> If a matrix has the characteristic equation
	<me>
	  (4-\lambda)^2(-5-\lambda)(1-\lambda)^7(3-\lambda)^2 = 0
	</me>,
	then that matrix has four eigenvalues:  <m>\lambda=4</m>
	having multiplicity 2; <m>\lambda=-5</m> having multiplicity
	1; <m>\lambda=1</m> having multiplicity 7; and <m>\lambda=3</m>
	having multiplicity 2.  The degree of the characteristic
	polynomial is the sum of the multiplicities <m>2+1+7+2 =
	12</m> so this matrix must be a <m>12\times12</m>
	matrix. </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p> The multiplicities of the eigenvalues are important because
    they influence the dimension of the eigenspaces.  We know that the
    dimension of an eigenspace must be at least one; the following
    proposition also tells us the dimension of an eigenspace can be no
    larger than the multiplicity of its associated eigenvalue. </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-eigen-basis" >
      <statement>
	<p> If <m>\lambda</m> is a real eigenvalue of the matrix
	<m>A</m> with multiplicity <m>m</m>, then
	<me>
	  1 \leq \dim~E_\lambda \leq m
	  </me>.
	  </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> The diagonal matrix
	<m>\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	-1 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp -1 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	</m> has the characteristic equation <m>(-1-\lambda)^2 =
	0</m>.  There is a single eigenvalue <m>\lambda = -1</m> having
	multiplicity <m>m = 2</m>, and we saw earlier that
	<m>\dim E_{-1} = 2 \leq m = 2</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p>The matrix
	<m>\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	1 \amp 1 \\
	-1 \amp 3 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	</m> has the characteristic equation <m>(2-\lambda)^2 =
	0</m>.  This tells us that there is a single eigenvalue <m>\lambda =
	2</m> having 
	multiplicity <m>m = 2</m>.  In contrast with the previous
	example, we have
	<m>\dim~ E_2 = 1 \leq m = 2</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> We saw earlier that the matrix
	<m>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  4 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\
	  0 \amp -2 \amp -1 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 3 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</m> has the characteristic equation
	<me>(4-\lambda)(-2-\lambda)(3-\lambda)=0</me>.
	There are three eigenvalues <m>\lambda=3,-2,1</m> each having
	multiplicity <m>1</m>.  By the proposition, we are guaranteed
	that the dimension of each eigenspace is <m>1</m>;  that is,
	<me>
	  \dim E_3 = \dim E_{-2} = \dim E_1 = 1
	</me>.
	It turns out that this is enough to guarantee that there is a
	basis of <m>\real^3</m> consisting of eigenvectors. </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> If a <m>12\times12</m> matrix has the characteristic
	equation 
	<me>
	  (4-\lambda)^2(-5-\lambda)(1-\lambda)^7(3-\lambda)^2 = 0
	</me>,
	we know there are four eigenvalues <m>\lambda=4,-5,1,3</m>.
	Without more information, all we can say about the dimensions
	of the eigenspaces is 
	<me>
	  \begin{aligned}
	  1 \leq \dim E_4 \amp {}\leq{} 2 \\
	  1 \leq \dim E_{-5} \amp {}\leq{} 1 \\
	  1 \leq \dim E_1 \amp {}\leq{} 7 \\
	  1 \leq \dim E_3 \amp {}\leq{} 2\text{.} \\
	  \end{aligned}
	</me>
	We can guarantee that <m>\dim E_{-5} = 1</m>, but we cannot be
	more specific about the dimensions of the other eigenspaces.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p> Fortunately, if we have an <m>n\times n</m> matrix, it frequently
    happens that the characteristic equation has the form
    <me>
      (\lambda_1-\lambda)
      (\lambda_2-\lambda)
      \ldots
      (\lambda_n-\lambda) = 0
    </me>
    where there are <m>n</m> distinct real eigenvalues, each of which
    has multiplicity <m>1</m>.  In this case, the dimension of each of
    the eigenspaces <m>\dim E_{\lambda_j} = 1</m>.  With a little
    work, it can be seen that choosing a basis vector <m>\vvec_j</m> for
    each of the eigenspaces produces a basis for <m>\real^n</m>.  We
    therefore have the following proposition. </p>

    <proposition>
      <statement>
	<p> If <m>A</m> is an <m>n\times n</m> matrix having <m>n</m>
	distinct real eigenvalues, then there is a basis of <m>\real^n</m>
	consisting of eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.</p>
      </statement>

    <title> Using Sage to find eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors </title>

    <p> We can use Sage to find the characteristic polynomial,
    eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of a matrix.  As we will see,
    however, some care is required when dealing with matrices whose
    entries include decimals.  
    </p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
      <p> We will use Sage to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
      a matrix.  Let's begin with the matrix
      <m>A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      -3 \amp 1 \\
      0 \amp -3 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </m>.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p>
	  We can find the characteristic polynomial of 
	  <m>A</m> by writing 
	  <c>A.charpoly('lambda')</c>.  Notice that we have to give Sage a
	  variable in which to write the polynomial;  here, we use
	  <c>lambda</c> though <c>x</c> works just as well. </p>

	  <sage>
	    <input>
A = matrix(2,2,[-3,1,0,-3])
A.charpoly('lambda')
	    </input>
	  </sage>

	  <p> The factored form of the characteristic polynomial may
	  be more useful since it will tell us the eigenvalues and
	  their multiplicities.  The factored characteristic polynomial is
	  found with <c>A.fcp('lambda')</c>. </p>
	  
	  <sage>
	    <input>
A = matrix(2,2,[-3,1,0,-3])
A.fcp('lambda')
	    </input>
	  </sage>
	</li>

	<li><p> If we only want the eigenvalues, we can use
	<c>A.eigenvalues()</c>.  </p>

	  <sage>
	    <input>
A = matrix(2,2,[-3,1,0,-3])
A.eigenvalues()
	    </input>
	  </sage>

	  <p> Notice that the multiplicity of an eigenvalue is the
	  number of times it is repeated in the list of
	  eigenvalues. </p>
	</li>

	<li><p> Finally, we can find eigenvectors by
	<c>A.eigenvectors_right()</c>.  (We are looking for
	<em>right</em> eigenvalues since the vector <m>\vvec</m>
	appears to the right of <m>A</m> in the definition
	<m>A\vvec=\lambda \vvec</m>.) </p>
	  
	  <sage>

	  <p> At first glance, the result of this command can be a
	  little confusing to interpret.  What we see is a list with
	  one entry for each eigenvalue.  For each eigenvalue, there
	  is a triple consisting of (i) the eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>,
	  (ii) a basis for <m>E_\lambda</m>, and (iii) the
	  multiplicity of <m>\lambda</m>. </p> </li>

	  <li><p> When working with decimal entries, which are called
	  <em>floating point numbers</em> in computer science, we must
	  remember that computers perform only approximate arithmetic.
	  This is a problem when we wish to find the eigenvectors of such a
	  matrix.  To illustrate, consider the matrix
	  <m>A=\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  0.4 \amp 0.3 \\
	  0.6 \amp 0.7 \\
	  \end{array}\right]

    <title> Summary </title>

    <p> In this section, we developed a technique for finding the
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an <m>n\times n</m> matrix
    <m>A</m>. 
    <ul>
      <li><p> The expression <m>\det(A-\lambda I)</m> is a degree
      <m>n</m> polynomial, known as the characteristic polynomial of
      <m>A</m>.  The eigenvalues of <m>A</m> are the roots of the
      characteristic polynomial found by solving the characteristic
      equation <m>\det(A-\lambda I) = 0</m>. </p></li>

      <li><p> The set of eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalue
      <m>\lambda</m> forms a subspace of <m>\real^n</m>, the
      eigenspace <m>E_\lambda = 
      \nul(A-\lambda I)</m>. </p></li>

      <li><p> If the factor <m>(\lambda_j - \lambda)</m> appears
      <m>m_j</m> times in the characteristic polynomial, we say that
      the eigenvalue <m>\lambda_j</m> has multiplicity <m>m_j</m> and
      note that
      <me>
	1 \leq \dim E_{\lambda_j} \leq m_j
      </me>.
      </p></li>

      <li><p> If each of the eigenvalues is real and has multiplicity
      <m>1</m>, then we can form a basis of <m>\real^n</m> consisting
      of eigenvectors of <m>A</m>. </p></li>

      <li><p> We can use Sage to find the eigenvalues and eigenvalues
      of matrices.  However, we need to be careful working with
      floating point numbers since floating point arithmetic is only
      an approximation. </p></li>
    </ul></p>
