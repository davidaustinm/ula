  <title> Orthogonality and Least Squares </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We introduced vectors as a means to develop visual intuition
      about our basic questions concerning linear systems.  For
      example, vectors allow us to reinterpret questions about the
      existence of solutions to linear systems as questions about the
      span of a set of vectors.  Questions about the uniqueness of
      solutions led to the concept of linear independence.

      In this chapter, we will begin to think of vectors as geometric
      objects that have lengths and that form angles.  In some cases,
      this will simplify our search for solutions to a linear system.
      Perhaps more importantly, we will be able to measure the
      distance between vectors.  This means that if a system
      <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> is inconsistent, we can look for
      <m>\xhat</m>, the vector for which <m>A\xhat</m> is as close to
      <m>\bvec</m> as possible.  This leads to the method of <em>least
      squares</em>, which underpins regression, a key tool in
      data science.
