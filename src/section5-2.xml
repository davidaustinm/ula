  <title> Finding eigenvectors numerically  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> We have typically found eigenvalues of a square matrix
    <m>A</m> as the roots of the characteristic polynomial
    <m>\det(A-\lambda I) = 0</m> and the associated eigenvectors as
    the null space <m>\nul(A-\lambda I)</m>.  Unfortunately, this
    approach is not practical when we are working with large matrices.
    First, finding the charactertic polynomial of a large matrix
    requires considerable computation, as does finding the roots of
    that polynomial.  Second, finding the null space of a singular
    matrix is plagued by numerical problems, as we will see in the
    preview activity.
    </p>

    <p> For this reason, we will explore a technique called the
    <em>power method</em> that finds
    numerical approximations to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a
    square matrix.

  <subsection>
    <title> The power method </title>

    <p> Our goal is to find a technique that produces numerical
    approximations to the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of a
    matrix <m>A</m>.  We begin by searching for the eigenvalue having
    the largest absolute value, which is called the <em>dominant</em>
    eigenvalue.  The next two examples demonstrate this technique.
    <idx> eigenvalue, dominant </idx>
    </p>

    <example>
      <p> Let's begin with the positive stochastic matrix
      <m>A=\left[\begin{array}{rr}
      0.7 \amp 0.6 \\
      0.3 \amp 0.4 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </m>.
      We spent quite a bit of time studying this type of matrix in <xref
      ref="sec-stochastic" />; in particular, we saw that any Markov
      chain will converge to the unique steady-state vector.  Let's
      rephrase this statement in terms of the eigenvectors of <m>A</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
	This matrix has eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1 = 1</m> and
	<m>\lambda_2 =0.1</m> so the dominant eigenvalue is
	<m>\lambda_1 = 1</m>.
	The associated eigenvectors are <m>\vvec_1 =
	\twovec{2}{1}</m> and <m>\vvec_2 = \twovec{-1}{1}</m>. 
	Suppose we begin with the vector
	<me>
	  \xvec_0 = \twovec{1}{0} = \frac13 \vvec_1 - \frac13 \vvec_2
	</me>
	and find
	<me>
	  \begin{aligned}
	  \xvec_1 \amp {}={} A\xvec_0 = \frac13 \vvec_1 - \frac13(0.1)
	  \vvec_2 \\
	  \xvec_2 \amp {}={} A^2\xvec_0 = \frac13 \vvec_1 - \frac13(0.1)^2
	  \vvec_2 \\
	  \xvec_3 \amp {}={} A^3\xvec_0 = \frac13 \vvec_1 - \frac13(0.1)^3
	  \vvec_2 \\
	  \amp \vdots \\
	  \xvec_k \amp {}={} A^k\xvec_0 = \frac13 \vvec_1 - \frac13(0.1)^k
	  \vvec_2 \\
	  \end{aligned}
	</me>
	and so forth.  Notice that the powers <m>0.1^k</m> become
	increasingly small as <m>k</m> grows so that <m>\xvec_k\approx
	\frac13\vvec_1</m> when <m>k</m> is large.  Therefore, the
	vectors <m>\xvec_k</m> become increasingly close to a vector
	in the eigenspace <m>E_1</m>, the eigenspace associated to the
	dominant eigenvalue.  If we did not know the eigenvector
	<m>\vvec_1</m>, we could use a Markov chain in this way to
	find a basis vector for <m>E_1</m>, which, as seen in 
	<xref ref="sec-stochastic"/>, is essentially how
	the Google PageRank algorithm works.

      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <p> Let's now look at the matrix <m>A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      2 \amp 1 \\ 1 \amp 2 \\ \end{array}\right] </m>, which has
      eigenvalues <m>\lambda_1=3</m> and <m>\lambda_2 = 1</m>.  The
      dominant eigenvalue is <m>\lambda_1=3</m>, and the associated
      eigenvectors are <m>\vvec_1 = \twovec{1}{1}</m> and <m>\vvec_{2} =
      \twovec{-1}{1}</m>.  Once again, begin with the vector <m>
      \xvec_0 = \twovec{1}{0}=\frac12 \vvec_1 - \frac12 \vvec_2</m> so
      that
      <me>
	\begin{aligned}
	\xvec_1 \amp {}={} A\xvec_0 = 3\frac12 \vvec_1 - \frac12
	\vvec_2 \\
	\xvec_2 \amp {}={} A^2\xvec_0 = 3^2\frac13 \vvec_1 - \frac12
	\vvec_2 \\
	\xvec_3 \amp {}={} A^3\xvec_0 = 3^3\frac13 \vvec_1 - \frac12
	\vvec_2 \\
	\amp \vdots \\
	\xvec_k \amp {}={} A^k\xvec_0 = 3^k\frac13 \vvec_1 - \frac12
	\vvec_2\text{.} \\
	\end{aligned}
      </me>
      </p>

      <sidebyside widths="60% 40%">
	<p> As the figure shows, the vectors <m>\xvec_k</m> are
	stretched by a factor of <m>3</m> in the <m>\vvec_1</m>
	direction and not at all in the <m>\vvec_2</m> direction.
	Consequently, the vectors <m>\xvec_k</m> become increasingly
	long, but their direction becomes
	closer to the direction of the eigenvector
	<m>\vvec_1=\twovec{1}{1}</m> associated to the dominant
	eigenvalue. 
	</p>

	<image source="images/numerical-power" />
      </sidebyside>

      <p> To find an eigenvector associated to the dominant
      eigenvalue, we will prevent the length of the vectors
      <m>\xvec_k</m> from growing arbitrarily large by multiplying by
      an appropriate scaling constant.  Here is one way to do this.
      Given the vector <m>\xvec_k</m>, we identify its component
      having the largest absolute value and call it <m>m_k</m>.  We
      then define <m>\overline{\xvec}_k = \frac{1}{m_k} \xvec_k</m>,
      which means that the component of <m>\overline{\xvec}_k</m>
      having the largest absolute value is <m>1</m>.
      </p>

      <p> For example, beginning with <m>\xvec_0 = \twovec{1}{0}</m>, we
      find 
      <m>\xvec_1 = A\xvec_{0} =
      \twovec{2}{1}</m>.  The component of <m>\xvec_1</m> having the
      largest absolute value is <m>m_1=2</m> so we multiply by
      <m>\frac{1}{m_1} = \frac12</m> to obtain <m>\overline{\xvec}_1 =
      \twovec{1}{\frac12}</m>.  Then <m>\xvec_2 = A\overline{\xvec}_1 =
      \twovec{\frac52}{2}</m>.  Now the component having the largest
      absolute value is <m>m_2=\frac52</m> so we multiply by <m>\frac25</m>
      to obtain <m>\overline{\xvec}_2 = \twovec{1}{\frac45}</m>.  
      </p>

      <sidebyside widths="60% 40%">
	<p> The
	resulting sequence of vectors <m>\overline{\xvec}_k</m> is shown in
	the figure.  Notice how the vectors
	<m>\overline{\xvec}_k</m> now approach the eigenvector
	<m>\vvec_1</m>, which gives us a way to find the eigenvector
	<m>\vvec=\twovec{1}{1}</m>.
	This is the <em>power method</em> for
	finding an eigenvector associated to the dominant eigenvalue of
	a matrix.

    <p> Notice that the power method gives us not only an eigenvector
    <m>\vvec</m> but also its associated eigenvalue.  As in the
    activity, consider the matrix 
    <m>A=\left[\begin{array}{rr}
    -5.1 \amp 5.7 \\
    -3.8 \amp 4.4 \\
    \end{array}\right]
    </m>, which has eigenvector <m>\vvec=\twovec{3}{2}</m>.  The first
    component has the largest absolute value so we multiply by
    <m>\frac13</m> to obtain 
    <m>\overline{\vvec}=\twovec{1}{\frac23}</m>.  When we multiply by
    <m>A</m>, we have <m>A\overline{\vvec} = \twovec{-1.30}{-0.86}</m>.
    Notice that the first component still has the largest absolute
    value so that the multiplier <m>m=-1.3</m> is the eigenvalue
    <m>\lambda</m> corresponding to the eigenvector.  This
    demonstrates the fact that the multipliers <m>m_k</m> approach the
    eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> having the largest absolute value.</p>

    <p> Notice that the power method requires us to choose an initial
    vector <m>\xvec_0</m>.  For most choices, this method will find
    the eigenvalue having the largest absolute value.  However, an
    unfortunate choice of <m>\xvec_0</m> may not.  For instance, if we
    had chosen <m>\xvec_0 = \vvec_2</m> in our example above, the
    vectors in the sequence <m>\xvec_k =
    A^k\xvec_0=\lambda_2^k\vvec_2</m> will not detect the eigenvector
    <m>\vvec_1</m>.  However, it usually happens that our
    initial guess <m>\xvec_0</m> has some contribution from
    <m>\vvec_1</m> that enables us to find it.
    </p>

    <p> The power method, as presented here, will fail for certain
    unlucky matrices.  This is examined in <xref
    ref="exercise-power-method" /> along with a means to improve the
    power method to work for all matrices.

    <title> Finding other eigenvalues </title>

    <p> The power method gives a technique for finding the dominant
    eigenvalue 
    of a matrix.  We can modify
    the method to find the other eigenvalues as well.</p>

    <activity>
      <statement>
      <p> The key to finding the eigenvalue of <m>A</m> having the
      smallest absolute value is to note
      that the eigenvectors of <m>A</m> are the same as those of
      <m>A^{-1}</m>.

      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> If <m>\vvec</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with
	associated eigenvector <m>\lambda</m>, explain why
	<m>\vvec</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A^{-1}</m> with
	associated eigenvalue <m>\lambda^{-1}</m>. </p></li>

	<li><p> Explain why the eigenvalue of <m>A</m> having the

	<li><p> Explain how to use the power method applied
	to <m>A^{-1}</m> to find the eigenvalue of <m>A</m> having the

	<li><p> If we apply the power method to <m>A^{-1}</m>, we
	begin with an intial vector <m>\xvec_0</m> and generate the

	computationally efficient to compute <m>A^{-1}</m>, however,
	so instead we solve the equation <m>A\xvec_{k+1} =

    <p> There are some restrictions on the matrices to which this
    technique applies as we have assumed that the eigenvalues of

    <title> Summary </title>

    <p> We have explored the power method as a
    tool for numerically approximating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    of a matrix.
    <ul>
      <li><p> After choosing an initial vector <m>\xvec_0</m>, we
      define the sequence <m>\xvec_{k+1}=A\xvec_k</m>.  As <m>k</m>
      grows larger, the direction of the vectors
      <m>\xvec_k</m> closely approximates the direction
      of the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue
      <m>\lambda_1</m> having the
      largest absolute value. </p></li>

      <li><p> We normalize the vectors <m>\xvec_k</m> by multiplying
      by <m>\frac{1}{m_k}</m>, where <m>m_k</m> is the component
      having the largest absolute value.  In this way, the vectors
      <m>\overline{\xvec}_k</m> approach an eigenvector associated to
      <m>\lambda_1</m>, and the multipliers <m>m_k</m> approach the
      eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1</m>. </p></li>

      <li><p> To find the eigenvalue having the smallest absolute
      value, we apply the power method using the matrix
      <m>A^{-1}</m>.  </p></li>

      <li><p> To find the eigenvalue closest to some number <m>s</m>,
      we apply the power method using the matrix
      <m>(A-sI)^{-1}</m>. </p></li>
    </ul></p>
