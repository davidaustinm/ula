  <title> Determinants </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> As invertibility plays a central role in this chapter, we need
    a criterion that tells us when a matrix is invertible.  
    We already know that a square matrix is invertible if and only if
    it is row equivalent to the identity matrix.  In this section, we
    will develop a second, numerical criterion that tells us when a
    square matrix is invertible.
    </p>

    <p> To begin, let's consider a <m>2\times2</m> matrix <m>A</m>
    whose columns are vectors <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>.  We
    have frequently drawn the vectors and studied the linear
    combinations they form using a figure such as <xref
    ref="fig-intro-dets" />.

      </caption>
    </figure>

    <p> Notice how the linear combinations form a set of congruent
    parallelograms in the plane.  In this section, we will use the
    area of these parallelograms to define a numerical
    quantity called the determinant that tells us whether the matrix
    <m>A</m> is invertible.

      <p> To recall, the area of parallelogram
      is found by multiplying the length of one side by the
      perpendicular distance to its parallel side.  Using the notation
      in the figure, the area of the
      parallelogram is <m>bh</m>.

  <subsection>
    <title> Determinants of <m>2\times2</m> matrices </title>

    <p> We will begin by defining
    the determinant of a <m>2\times2</m> matrix <m>A =
    \left[\begin{array}{rr} \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2
    \end{array}\right]</m>.  First, however, we need to define the
    orientation of an ordered pair of vectors.  As shown in <xref
    ref="fig-det-orientation" />, an ordered pair of vectors
    <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> is called <em>positively</em>
    oriented if the angle, measured in the counterclockwise direction,
    from <m>\vvec_1</m> to <m>\vvec_2</m> is less than
    <m>180^\circ</m>; we say the pair is <em>negatively</em> oriented if
    it is more than <m>180^\circ</m>.
    </p>

            <p>The diagram on the left shows two vectors <m>\vvec_1</m>
            and <m>\vvec_2</m> both in the first quadrant.
            The vector
            <m>\vvec_1</m> makes a smaller angle with the positive
            horizontal axis so that rotating <m>\vvec_1</m>
            counterclockwise by an angle less than <m>180^\circ</m>
            causes the two vectors to point in the same direction.
            We say these vectors are positively oriented.</p>
            <p>The diagram on the right shows the same two vectors but
            the names of the vectors have been interchanged so that
            <m>\vvec_1</m> now
            makes a larger angle with the positive horizontal axis.
            The vector <m>\vvec_1</m> needs to be rotated
            counterclockwise by an angle greater than <m>180^\circ</m>
            to cause the vectors to point in the same direction.  This
            pair of vectors is negatively oriented.</p>

    <p> Later in this section, we will learn an algebraic
    technique for computing determinants.  In the meantime, 
    we will simply note that we can define determinants for <m>n\times
    n</m> matrices by measuring the volume of a box defined by the columns
    of the matrix, even if this box resides in <m>\real^n</m> for
    some very large <m>n</m>.

      <p> For example, the columns of a <m>3\times3</m> matrix
      <m>A</m> will form a parallelpiped, like the one shown here, and
      there is a means by which we can classify sets of such vectors
      as either positively or negatively oriented.  Therefore, we can
      define the determinant <m>\det(A)</m> in terms of the volume of
      the parallelpiped, but we will not worry about the details here.

    <title> Determinants and invertibility </title>

    <p>
      Perhaps the most important property of determinants also
      appeared in the previous activity.  We saw that when the columns
      of the matrix <m>A</m> are linearly dependent, the
      parallelogram formed by those vectors folds down onto a line.
      For instance, if <m>A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp -1 \\ 2 \amp -2 \\
      \end{bmatrix}</m>, then the resulting parallelogram, as shown
      in
      <xref ref="figure-linear-dep-det"/>, has zero area, which means
      that <m>\det(A)=0</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The condition that the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly
      dependent is precisely the same as the condition that <m>A</m>
      is not invertible.  This leads us to believe that <m>A</m> is
      not invertible if and only if its determinant is zero.  
      The following proposition expresses this thought.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-invertible-det">
      <statement>
	<p> The matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if <m>\det(A)
	\neq 0</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p> To understand this proposition more fully, let's remember that the
    matrix <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if it is row equivalent
    to the identity matrix <m>I</m>.  We will therefore consider how
    the determinant changes when we perform row operations on a matrix.
    Along the way, we will discover an effective means to compute the
    determinant.
    </p>

    <p> In <xref ref="subsec-triangular-invertible" />, we saw how to
    describe the three row operations, scaling, interchange, and 
    replacement, using matrix multiplication.  If we perform a row
    operation on the matrix <m>A</m> to obtain the matrix <m>A'</m>,
    we would like to relate <m>\det(A)</m> and <m>\det(A')</m>.  To do
    so, 
    remember that
    <ul>
      <li> <p> Scalings are performed by multiplying a matrix <m>A</m>
      by a diagonal
      matrix, such as 
      <me>
	S = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 3 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}\right],
      </me>
      which has the effect of multiplying the second row of <m>A</m>
      by <m>3</m> to obtain <m>A'</m>.  Since <m>S</m> is diagonal, we
      know that its determinant is the product of its diagonal entries
      so that <m>\det(S) = 3</m>.  
      This means that <m>A'=SA</m> and therefore
      <me>\det(A')=\det(S)\det(A) = 3\det(A).</me> In general, if we
      scale a row of <m>A</m> by 
      <m>k</m>, we have <m>\det(A') =
      k\det(A)</m>.  </p></li>

      <li><p> Interchanges are performed by matrices such
      as
      <me>
	P = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}\right],
      </me>
      which has the effect of interchanging the first and second rows
      of <m>A</m>.  As we saw in <xref
      ref="proposition-det-properties"/>, <m>\det(P) = -1</m>.
      Therefore, when <m>PA=A'</m>, we have <me>\det(A')=\det(P)
      \det(A) = -\det(A).</me> In other words, <m>\det(A') =
      -\det(A)</m> when we perform an interchange.  </p></li>

      <li><p> Row replacement operations are performed by matrices
      such as
      <me>
	R = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	-2 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}\right],
      </me>
      which multiplies the first row by <m>-2</m> and adds the result
      to the third row.  Since this is a lower triangular matrix, we
      know that the determinant is the product of the diagonal entries,
      which says that <m>\det(R) = 1</m>.  This means that when
      <m>RA = A'</m>,
      we have <m>\det(A')=\det(R)\det(A) = \det(A)</m>.  In
      other words, a row replacement does not change the determinant.

      <solution>
	<p><ol marker="a.">
	  <li><p> The matrix <m>U_1</m> is invertible because we see

	  <li><p> The determinant of an upper triangular matrix equals

	  <li><p> In the same way, <m>\det(A) =

	  <li><p> The determinant <m>\det(U) = -4</m> since it is the

	  because <m>U</m>, which has a pivot position in every row
	  and every column, is invertible.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> Beginning with a row replacement operation, we

    </activity>

    <p> As seen in this activity, row operations can be used to
    compute the determinant of a matrix.  More specifically, 
    applying the forward substitution phase of Gaussian
    elimination to the matrix <m>A</m> leads us to an upper triangular
    matrix <m>U</m> so that <m>A\sim U</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We know that <m>U</m> is
      invertible when all of its diagonal entries are nonzero.  We also
      know that <m>\det(U)\neq 0</m> under the same condition.  This
      tells us <m>U</m> is invertible if and only if <m>\det(U) \neq 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now if <m>\det(A)\neq 0</m>, we also have <m>\det(U)\neq 0</m>
      since applying a sequence of row operations to <m>A</m> only
      multiplies the determinant by a nonzero number.  It then follows
      that <m>U</m> is invertible so <m>U\sim I</m>.  Therefore, we
      also know that <m>A\sim I</m> and so <m>A</m> must also be
      invertible.

    <p>
      This explains <xref ref="prop-invertible-det"/> and so we know

      if and only if <m>\det(A)\neq 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, notice that if <m>A</m> is invertible, we have
      <m>A^{-1}A = I</m>, 
      which tells us that
      <me>
	\det(A^{-1}A) = \det(A^{-1})\det(A) = 1.
      </me>
      Therefore, <m>\det(A^{-1}) = 1/\det(A)</m>.

    <proposition>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  If <m>A</m> is an invertible matrix, then
	  <m>\det(A^{-1}) = 1/\det(A)</m>.

    <title> Cofactor expansions </title>

    <p> We now have a technique for computing the determinant of a
    matrix using row operations.  There is another way to compute
    determinants, using what are called <em>cofactor expansions</em>,
    that will be important for us in the next chapter. 
    We will describe this method here.
    </p>

    <p> To begin, the determinant of a <m>2\times2</m> matrix is
    <me>
      \det\left[\begin{array}{rr}
      a \amp b \\
      c \amp d \\
      \end{array}\right]
      =
      ad-bc
    </me>.  With a little bit of work, it can be shown that this
    number is the same as the signed area of the parallelogram we
    introduced earlier.
    </p>

    <p> Using a cofactor expansion to find the determinant of a more
    general <m>n\times n</m> matrix is a little more work so we will
    demonstrate it with an example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> We illustrate how to use a cofactor expansion to find the
	determinant of <m>A</m> where
	<me>
	  A = 
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	  -2 \amp 2 \amp -6 \\
	  3 \amp -1 \amp 10 \\
	  \end{array}\right].
	</me>
	</p>

	<p> To begin, we choose one row or column.  It doesn't matter
	which we choose because the result will be the same in any
	case.  Here, we choose the second row
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  \lgray{1} \amp \lgray{-1} \amp \lgray{2} \\
	  -2 \amp 2 \amp -6 \\
	  \lgray{3} \amp \lgray{-1} \amp \lgray{10} \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>.
	</p>

	<p> The determinant will be found by creating a sum of terms,
	one for each entry in the row we have chosen.  For each entry
	in the row, we form its term by
	multiplying
	<ul>
	  <li><p> <m>(-1)^{i+j}</m> where <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> are
	  the row and column numbers, respectively, of the
	  entry, </p></li>
	  <li><p> the entry itself, and </p></li>
	  <li><p> the determinant of the entries left over when we
	  have crossed out the row and column containing the
	  entry. </p> </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p> Since we are computing the determinant of this matrix
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  \gray{1} \amp \gray{-1} \amp \gray{2} \\
	  -2 \amp 2 \amp -6 \\
	  \gray{3} \amp \gray{-1} \amp \gray{10} \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>
	using the second row, the entry in the first column of this
	row is <m>-2</m>.  Let's see 
	how to form the term from this entry.
	</p>

	<p> The term itself is <m>-2</m>, and the matrix that is left
	over when we cross out the second row and first column is
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  \gray{1} \amp {-1} \amp {2} \\
	  \gray{-2} \amp \gray{2} \amp \gray{-6} \\
	  \gray{3} \amp {-1} \amp {10} \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>
	whose determinant is
	<me>
	  \det\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  -1 \amp 2 \\
	  -1 \amp 10 \\
	  \end{array}\right] =
	  -1(10) - 2 (-1) = -8
	</me>.
	Since this entry is in the second row and first column, the
	term we construct is
	<m> (-1)^{2+1}(-2)(-8) = -16
	</m>.
	</p>

	<p> Putting this together, we find the determinant to be
	<me>
	  \begin{aligned}
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  {1} \amp {-1} \amp {2} \\
	  -2 \amp {2} \amp {-6} \\
	  {3} \amp {-1} \amp {10} \\
	  \end{array}\right] 
	  {}={}
	  \amp
	  (-1)^{2+1}(-2)\det\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  -1 \amp 2 \\
	  -1 \amp 10 \\
	  \end{array}\right] \\
	  \amp
	  {}+{}
	  (-1)^{2+2}(2)\det\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  1 \amp 2 \\
	  3 \amp 10 \\
	  \end{array}\right] \\
	  \amp
	  {}+{}
	  (-1)^{2+3}(-6)\det\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  -1 \amp -1 \\
	  3 \amp -1 \\
	  \end{array}\right] \\
	  \\
	  {}={}
	  \amp
	  (-1)(-2)(-1(10)-2(-1)) \\
	  \amp + (1)(2)(1(10)-2(3)) \\
	  \amp + (-1)(-6)((-1)(-1)-(-1)3) \\ \\
	  {}={}
	  \amp
	  -16 + 8 + 12 \\
	  {}={}
	  \amp
	  4 \\

	  \end{aligned}
	</me>.
	Notice that this agrees with the determinant that we found for
	this matrix using row operations in the last activity.

    <title> Summary </title>

    <p> In this section, we associated a numerical quantity, the
    determinant, to a square matrix and showed how it tells us whether
    the matrix is invertible.

    <ul>
      <li><p> The determinant of a matrix has a geometric
      interpretation.  In particular, when
      <m>n=2</m>, the determinant is the signed area of
      the parallelogram formed by the two columns of the matrix.
      </p></li>

      <li><p> The determinant satisfies many properties.  For instance, 
      <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)</m> and
      the determinant of a triangular matrix is equal to the
      product of its diagonal entries. </p></li>

      <li><p> These properties helped us compute the determinant of a
      matrix using row operations.  This also led to the important
      observation that the determinant of a matrix is nonzero if and
      only if the matrix is invertible. </p></li>

      <li><p> Finally, we learned how to compute the determinant of a
      matrix using cofactor expansions, which will be
      a valuable tool
      for us in the next chapter. </p></li>
    </ul></p>

    <p> We have seen three ways to compute the
    determinant: by interpreting the determinant as a signed area or
    volume; by applying appropriate row operations; and by using a
    cofactor expansion.  It's worth spending a moment to think about
    the relative merits of these approaches.
    </p>

    <p> The geometric definition of the determinant tells us that the
    determinant is measuring a natural geometric quantity, an insight
    that does not easily come through the other two approaches.  The
    intuition we gain by thinking about the determinant geometrically
    makes it seem reasonable that the determinant should be zero for
    matrices that are not invertible: if the columns are linearly
    dependent, the vectors cannot create a positive volume.
    </p>

    <p> Approaching the determinant through row operations provides an
    effective means of computing the determinant.  In fact, this is
    what most computer programs do behind the scenes when they
    compute a determinant.  This approach is also a useful theoretical
    tool for explaining why the determinant tells us whether a matrix
    is invertible.
    </p>

    <p> The cofactor expansion method will be useful to us in the next
    chapter when we look at eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  It is not,
    however, a practical way to compute a determinant.  To see why,
    consider the fact that the determinant of a <m>2\times2</m>
    matrix, written as <m>ad-bc</m>,
    requires us to compute two terms, <m>ad</m> and <m>bc</m>.  To
    compute the determinant of a <m>3\times3</m> matrix, we need to
    compute three <m>2\times2</m> determinants, which involves
    <m>3\cdot 2 = 6</m> terms.  For a <m>4\times4</m> matrix, we need
    to compute four <m>3\times3</m> determinants, which produces
    <m>4\cdot3\cdot2 = 24</m> terms.  Continuing in this way, we see
    that the cofactor expansion of a <m>10\times10</m> matrix would
    involve <m>10\cdot9\cdot8\ldots3\cdot2 = 10! = 3628800</m> terms.
    </p>

    <p> By contrast, we have seen that the number of steps required to
    perform Gaussian elimination on an <m>n\times n</m> matrix is
    proportional to <m>n^3</m>.  When <m>n=10</m>, we have <m>n^3 =
    1000</m>, which points to the fact that finding the determinant
    using Gaussian elimination is considerably less work.
    </p>
