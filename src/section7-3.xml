  <title> Principal Component Analysis </title>

  <introduction>

    <p>
      We are sometimes presented with a dataset having many data
      points that live in a high dimensional space.  For instance, we
      looked at a dataset describing body fat index (BFI) in
      <xref ref="activity-BFI" /> where each data point is
      six-dimensional.  Developing an intuitive understanding of the
      data is hampered by the fact that it cannot be visualized.
    </p>

    <p>
      This section explores a technique called <em> principal
      component analysis</em>, which enables us to reduce the
      dimension of a dataset so that it may be visualized or studied
      in a way so that interesting features more readily stand out.
      Our previous work with variance and the orthogonal
      diagonalization of symmetric matrices provides the key ideas.

    <p>
      Here are some ideas we've seen previously that will be
      particularly useful for us in this section.  Remember that 
      the covariance matrix of a dataset is <m>C=\frac 1N AA^T</m>
      where <m>A</m> is the matrix of <m>N</m> demeaned
      data points.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    When <m>\uvec</m> is a unit vector, the variance of the
	    demeaned data after projecting onto the line defined by
	    <m>\uvec</m> is given by the quadratic form <m>V_{\uvec} =
	    \uvec\cdot(C\uvec)</m>.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    In particular, if <m>\uvec</m> is a unit eigenvector of
	    <m>C</m> with associated eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m>, then
	    <m>V_{\uvec} = \lambda</m>.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    Moreover, variance is additive, as we recorded in <xref
	    ref="prop-variance-additivity" />: if <m>W</m> is a subspace
	    having an orthonormal basis
	    <m>\uvec_1,\uvec_2,\ldots,\uvec_n</m>, then the variance
	    <me>
	      V_W = V_{\uvec_1} + V_{\uvec_2} + \ldots +
	      V_{\uvec_n}\text{.} 
	    </me>

    <activity>
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Suppose that we work with a dataset having 100
	  five-dimensional data points.  The demeaned data matrix
	  <m>A</m> is therefore <m>5\times100</m> and leads to the
	  covariance matrix <m>C=\frac1{100}~AA^T</m>, which is a
	  <m>5\times5</m> matrix.  Because <m>C</m> is symmetric, the
	  Spectral Theorem tells us it is orthogonally diagonalizable
	  so suppose that <m>C = QDQ^T</m> where
	  <me>
	    Q = \begin{bmatrix}
	    \uvec_1 \amp \uvec_2 \amp \uvec_3 \amp \uvec_4 \amp \uvec_5

    <p>
      This activity demonstrates how the eigenvalues of the covariance
      matrix can tell us when data are clustered around, or even wholly
      contained within, a smaller dimensional subspace.  In
      particular, the original data is 5-dimensional, but we see
      that it actually lies in a 3-dimensional subspace of
      <m>\real^5</m>.  Later in this section, we'll see how to use
      this observation to work with the data as if it were
      three-dimensional, an idea known as <em>dimensional
      reduction</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <idx> principal components</idx> The eigenvectors <m>\uvec_j</m>
      of the covariance matrix are called <em>principal
      components</em>, and we will order them so that their associated
      eigenvalues decrease.  Generally speaking, we hope that the
      first few principal components retain most of the variance, as
      the example in the activity demonstrates.  In that example, we
      have the sequence of subspaces
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    <m>W_1</m>, the 1-dimensional subspace spanned by
	    <m>\uvec_1</m>, which retains <m>13/25 = 52\%</m> of the
	    total variance,
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    <m>W_2</m>, the 2-dimensional subspace spanned by
	    <m>\uvec_1</m> and <m>\uvec_2</m>, which retains <m>23/25
	    = 92\%</m> of the variance, and
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    <m>W_3</m>, the 3-dimensional subspace spanned by
	    <m>\uvec_1</m>, <m>\uvec_2</m>, and <m>\uvec_3</m>, which
	    retains all of the variance.
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice how we retain more of the total variance as we increase
      the dimension of the subspace onto which the data are projected.
      Eventually, projecting the data onto <m>W_3</m> retains all the
      variance, which tells us the data must lie in <m>W_3</m>, a
      smaller dimensional subspace of <m>\real^5</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, these subspaces are the best possible.  We know that
      the first principal component <m>\uvec_1</m> is the eigenvector
      of <m>C</m> associated to the largest eigenvalue.  This means
      that the variance is as large as possible in the <m>\uvec_1</m>
      direction.  In other words, projecting onto any other line
      will retain a smaller amount of variance.  Similarly, projecting
      onto any other 2-dimensional subspace besides <m>W_2</m> will
      retain less variance than projecting onto <m>W_2</m>.  The
      principal components have the wonderful ability to pick out the
      best possible subspaces to retain as much variance as
      possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, this is a contrived example.  Typically, the presence
      of noise in a dataset means that we do not expect all the points
      to be wholly contained in a smaller dimensional subspace.  In
      fact, the 2-dimensional subspace <m>W_2</m> retains
      <m>92\%</m> of the variance.  Depending on the situation, we may
      want to write off the remaining <m>8\%</m> of the variance as
      noise in exchange for the convenience of working with a smaller
      dimensional subspace.  As we'll see later, we will seek a
      balance using a number of principal components large enough to
      retain most of the variance but small enough to be easy to work
      with.

      This example is a more realistic illustration of principal
      component analysis.  The plot of the 3-dimensional data
      appears to show that the data lies close to a plane, and the
      principal components will identify this plane.  Starting with
      the <m>3\times100</m> matrix of demeaned data <m>A</m>, we
      construct the covariance matrix <m>C=\frac{1}{100} ~AA^T</m> and
      study its eigenvalues.  Notice that the first two principal
      components account for more than 98% of the variance, which
      means we can expect the points to lie close to <m>W_2</m>, the
      two-dimensional subspace spanned by <m>\uvec_1</m> and
      <m>\uvec_2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since <m>W_2</m> is a subspace of <m>\real^3</m>, 
      projecting the data points onto <m>W_2</m> gives a list of 100
      points in <m>\real^3</m>.  In order to visualize them more
      easily, we instead consider the coordinates of the projections
      in the basis defined by <m>\uvec_1</m> and <m>\uvec_2</m>.  For
      instance, we know that the projection of a data point
      <m>\xvec</m> is
      <me>
	\xhat = (\uvec_1\cdot\xvec)\uvec_1 +
	(\uvec_2\cdot\xvec)\uvec_2,
      </me>
      which is a three-dimensional vector.  Instead, we can record the
      coordinates <m>\twovec{\uvec_1\cdot\xvec}{\uvec_2\cdot\xvec}</m>
      and plot them in the two-dimensional coordinate plane, as
      illustrated in <xref ref="fig-pca-coords" />.
    </p>

	The projection <m>\xhat</m> of a data point <m>\xvec</m> onto
	<m>W_2</m> is a three-dimensional vector, which may be
	represented by the two coordinates describing this vector as a
	linear combination of <m>\uvec_1</m> and <m>\uvec_2</m>.
      </caption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      If we form the matrix <m>Q=\begin{bmatrix}\uvec_1 \amp \uvec_2
      \end{bmatrix}</m>, then we have
      <me>
	Q^T\xvec = \twovec{\uvec_1\cdot\xvec}{\uvec_2\cdot\xvec}.
      </me>
      This means that the columns of <m>Q^TA</m> represent the
      coordinates of the projected points, which may now be plotted in
      the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this plot, the first coordinate, represented by the
      horizontal coordinate, represents the projection of a data point
      onto the line defined by <m>\uvec_1</m> while the second
      coordinate represents the projection onto the line defined by
      <m>\uvec_2</m>.  Since <m>\uvec_1</m> is the first principal
      component, the variance in the <m>\uvec_1</m> direction is
      greater than the variance in the <m>\uvec_2</m> direction.  For
      this reason, the plot will be more spread out in the horizontal
      direction than in the vertical.

    <p>
      This activity demonstrates how principal component analysis
      enables us to extract information from a dataset that may not be
      easily obtained otherwise.  As in our previous example, we see
      that the data points lie quite close to a
      two-dimensional subspace of <m>\real^{17}</m>.  In fact,
      <m>W_2</m>, the subspace spanned by the first two principal
      components, accounts for more than 96% of the variance.
      More importantly, when we project the data onto <m>W_2</m>, it
      becomes apparent that Northern Ireland is fundamentally
      different from the other three nations.
    </p>

    <p>
      With some additional thought, we can determine more specific
      ways in which Northern Ireland is different.  On the
      <m>2</m>-dimensional plot, Northern Ireland lies far to the right
      compared to the other three nations.  Since the data has been
      demeaned, the origin <m>(0,0)</m> in this plot corresponds to
      the average of the four nations.  The coordinates of the point
      representing Northern Ireland are about <m>(477, 59)</m>,
      meaning that the projected data point differs from the mean by
      about <m>477\uvec_1+59\uvec_2</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's just focus on the contribution from <m>\uvec_1</m>.  We
      see that the ninth component of <m>\uvec_1</m>, the one that
      describes Fresh Fruit, is about <m>-0.63</m>.  This means that
      the ninth component of <m>477\uvec_1</m> differs from the mean
      by about <m>477(-0.63) = -300</m> grams per person per week.  So
      roughly speaking, people in Northern Ireland are eating about
      300 fewer grams of Fresh Fruit than the average across the four
      nations.  This is borne out by looking at the original data,
      which show that the consumption of Fresh Fruit in Northern
      Ireland is significantly less than the other nations.  Examing
      the other components of <m>\uvec_1</m> shows other ways in
      which Northern Ireland differs from the other three nations.

		Suppose you have an iris, but you only know that its
		sepal length is 5.65 cm and its sepal width is 2.75
		cm.  Knowing only these two measurements, determine
		the coordinates <m>(c_1, c_2)</m> in the plane where
		this iris lies.  To what species does this iris most
		likely belong?  Now estimate the petal length and petal
		width of this iris.

		Subtracting the mean sepal length and sepal width, we

	      <p>
		Using the same approach as the last part, we find

    <title> Summary </title>

    <p>
      This section has explored principal component analysis as a
      technique to reduce the dimension of a dataset.  From the
      demeaned data matrix <m>A</m>, we form the covariance matrix
      <m>C= \frac1N ~AA^T</m>, where <m>N</m> is the number of data
      points. 
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <p>
	    The eigenvectors <m>\uvec_1, \uvec_2, \ldots \uvec_m</m>,
	    of <m>C</m> are called the principal components.  We arrange
	    them so that their corresponding eigenvalues are in
	    decreasing order.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    If <m>W_n</m> is the subspace spanned by the first
	    <m>n</m> principal components, then the variance of the
	    demeaned data projected onto <m>W_n</m> is the sum of the
	    first <m>n</m> eigenvalues of <m>C</m>.  No other
	    <m>n</m>-dimensional subspace retains more variance when
	    the data is projected onto it.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    If <m>Q</m> is the matrix whose columns are the first
	    <m>n</m> principal components, then the columns of
	    <m>Q^TA</m> hold the coordinates, expressed in the basis
	    <m>\uvec_1,\ldots,\uvec_n</m>, of the data once
	    projected onto <m>W_n</m>.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <p>
	    Our goal is to use a number of principal components that
	    is large enough to retain most of the variance in the
	    dataset but small enough to be manageable.
	  </p>
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
