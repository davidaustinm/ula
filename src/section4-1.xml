  <title> An introduction to eigenvalues and eigenvectors </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> This section introduces the concept of eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors and offers an example that motivates our interest in
    them.  The point here is to develop an intuitive understanding of
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors and explain how they can be used to
    simplify some problems that we have previously encountered.
    In the rest of this chapter, we will develop this concept
    into a richer theory and illustrate its use with more meaningful
    examples. </p>

  <subsection>
    <title> A few examples </title>

    <p> We will now introduce the definition of eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors and then look at a few simple examples.</p> 

    <definition xml:id="definition-eigenvectors">
      <statement>
	<idx> eigenvalue </idx>
	<idx> eigenvector </idx>
	<p> Given a square <m>n\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m>, we say
	that a nonzero vector <m>\vvec</m> is an <em>eigenvector</em>
	of <m>A</m> if there is a scalar <m>\lambda</m> such that
	<me>
	  A\vvec = \lambda \vvec
	</me>.
	The scalar <m>\lambda</m> is called the <em>eigenvalue</em>
	associated to the eigenvector <m>\vvec</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p> At first glance, there is a lot going on in this definition so
    let's look at an example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
	<p> Consider the matrix
	<m> A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	7 \amp 6 \\
	6 \amp -2 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	</m>
	and the vector <m>\vvec=\twovec{2}{1}</m>.  We find that
	<me>
	  A\vvec = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  7 \amp 6 \\
	  6 \amp -2 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \twovec{2}{1}
	  =
	  \twovec{20}{10}
	  =10\twovec{2}{1}
	  =10\vvec
	</me>.
	In other words, <m>A\vvec = 10\vvec</m>, which says that
	<m>\vvec</m> is an eigenvector of the matrix <m>A</m> with
	associated eigenvalue <m>\lambda = 10</m>.
	</p>

	<p> Similarly, if <m>\wvec = \twovec{-1}{2}</m>, we find that
	<me>
	  A\wvec = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  7 \amp 6 \\
	  6 \amp -2 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \twovec{-1}{2}
	  =
	  \twovec{5}{-10}
	  =-5\twovec{-1}{2}
	  =-5\wvec
	</me>.
	Here again, we have <m>A\wvec = -5\wvec</m> showing that
	<m>\wvec</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with associated
	eigenvalue <m>\lambda=-5</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <activity xml:id="activity-eigen-geom">
      <statement>
      <p> This definition has an important geometric interpretation
      that we will investigate here.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> Suppose that <m>\vvec</m> is a nonzero vector and
	that <m>\lambda</m> is a scalar.  What is the geometric
	relationship between <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\lambda\vvec</m>?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Let's now consider the eigenvector condition:
	<m>A\vvec = \lambda\vvec</m>.  Here we have two vectors,
	<m>\vvec</m> and <m>A\vvec</m>.  If <m>A\vvec =

	<p> Choose the matrix

	</p></li>

	<li><p> By algebraically computing <m>A\vvec</m>, verify that

	<li><p> If you multiply the eigenvector <m>\vvec</m> that you

	  <li><p> There are no eigenvectors.  The matrix

	</ol></p>
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p> Let's consider the ideas we saw in the activity in some more
    depth.  To be an eigenvector of <m>A</m>, the vector <m>\vvec</m>
    must satisfy <m>A\vvec = \lambda\vvec</m> for some scalar
    <m>\lambda</m>.  This means that <m>\vvec</m> and <m>A\vvec</m>
    are scalar multiples of each other so they must lie on
    the same line. </p>

    <p> Consider now the matrix
    <m>A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
    1 \amp 2 \\
    2 \amp 1 \\
    \end{array}\right]
    </m>.
    On the left of <xref ref="fig-eigen-intro" />, we see that
    <m>\vvec=\twovec{1}{0}</m> is not an eigenvector of <m>A</m> since
    the vectors <m>\vvec</m> and <m>A\vvec</m> do not lie on the same
    line.  On the right, however, we see that
    <m>\vvec=\twovec{1}{1}</m> is an eigenvector.  In fact,
    <m>A\vvec</m> is obtained from <m>\vvec</m> by stretching
    <m>\vvec</m> by a factor of <m>3</m>.  Therefore, <m>\vvec</m> is
    an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>\lambda = 3</m>.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p> It is not difficult to see that any multiple of
    <m>\twovec{1}{1}</m> is also an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with
    eigenvalue <m>\lambda = 3</m>.  Indeed, we will see later that all
    the eigenvectors associated to a given eigenvalue form a
    subspace of <m>\real^n</m>. </p>

    <p> In <xref ref="fig-eigen-intro-2" />, we see that
    <m>\vvec=\twovec{-1}{1}</m> is also an eigenvector with eigenvalue
    <m>\lambda =-1</m>.

	Here we see another eigenvector <m>\vvec</m> with eigenvalue
	<m>\lambda = -1</m>.
      </caption>
    </figure>

    <p> The interactive diagram we used in the activity is meant to
    convey the fact that the eigenvectors of a matrix <m>A</m> are
    special vectors.  Most of the time, the vectors <m>\vvec</m> and
    <m>A\vvec</m> appear visually unrelated.  For certain vectors,
    however, <m>\vvec</m> and <m>A\vvec</m> line up with one another.
    Something important is going on when that happens so we 
    call attention to these vectors by calling them eigenvectors.
    For these vectors, the operation of multiplying by
    <m>A</m> reduces to the much simpler operation of scalar
    multiplying by <m>\lambda</m>.  The reason eigenvectors are
    important is because it is extremely convenient to be able to
    replace matrix multiplication by scalar multiplication.
    </p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-eigen-use">
    <title> The usefulness of eigenvalues and eigenvectors </title>

    <p> In the next section, we will introduce an algebraic technique
    for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.  Before
    doing that, however, we would like to discuss why eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors are so useful.
    </p>

    <p> Let's continue looking at the example
    <m>A = \left[\begin{array}{rr} 1 \amp 2 \\ 2 \amp 1 \\
    \end{array}\right] </m>.  We have seen that <m>\vvec_1 =
    \twovec{1}{1}</m> is an eigenvector with eigenvalue
    <m>\lambda=3</m> and <m>\vvec_2=\twovec{-1}{1}</m> is an
    eigenvector with eigenvalue <m>\lambda = -1</m>.  This means that
    <m>A\vvec_1 = 3\vvec_1</m> and <m>A\vvec_2=-\vvec_2</m>.
    By the linearity of matrix multiplication, we can
    determine what happens when we multiply a linear
    combination of <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> by <m>A</m>:
    <me>A(c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2) = 3c_1\vvec_1 - c_2\vvec_2</me>.
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 50%">
      <p>
	For instance, if we consider the vector
	<m>\xvec=\vvec_1-2\vvec_2</m>, we find that
	<me>
	  \begin{aligned}
	  A\xvec\amp{}={}A(\vvec_1 - 2\vvec_2) \\
	  A\xvec\amp{}={} 3\vvec_1 + 2\vvec_2
	  \end{aligned}
	</me>
	as seen in the figure.
      </p>
      <image source="images/eigen-basis" />
    </sidebyside>

    <p> In other words, multiplying by <m>A</m> has the effect of
    stretching a vector <m>\xvec</m> in the
    <m>\vvec_1</m> direction by a factor of <m>3</m> and flipping 
    <m>\xvec</m> in <m>\vvec_2</m> direction.
    </p>

    <p> We can draw an analogy with the more familiar example of the
    diagonal matrix 
    <m>D=\left[\begin{array}{rr}
    3 \amp 0 \\
    0 \amp -1 \\
    \end{array}\right]
    </m>.
    As we have seen, the matrix transformation defined by <m>D</m>
    combines a horizontal stretching by a factor of 3 with a
    reflection across the horizontal axis, as is illustrated
    in <xref ref="fig-eigen-intro-diagonal" />.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-eigen-intro-diagonal">
      <sidebyside width="80%">
	<image source="images/eigen-intro-diagonal" />
      </sidebyside>
      <caption> The diagonal matrix <m>D</m> stretches vectors
      horizontally by a factor of <m>3</m> and flips vectors
      vertically. 
      </caption>
    </figure>

    <p> The matrix
    <m>A=\left[\begin{array}{rr}
    1 \amp 2 \\
    2 \amp 1 \\
    \end{array}\right]
    </m>
    has a similar effect when viewed in the basis defined by the
    eigenvectors <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>, as seen in <xref
    ref="fig-eigen-intro-A" />.
    </p>
    
    <figure xml:id="fig-eigen-intro-A">
      <sidebyside width="80%">
	<image source="images/eigen-intro-A" />
      </sidebyside>
      <caption> The matrix <m>A</m> has the same geometric effect as
      the diagonal matrix <m>D</m> when expressed in the
      coordinate system defined by the basis of eigenvectors.  
      </caption>
    </figure>

    <p> In a sense that will be made precise later, having a set of
    eigenvectors of <m>A</m> that forms a basis of <m>\real^2</m>
    enables us to think of <m>A</m> as being equivalent to a diagonal
    matrix <m>D</m>.  Of course, as the other examples in the previous
    activity show, it may not always be possible to form a basis from the
    eigenvectors of a matrix.  For example, the only eigenvectors of
    the matrix <m>\left[\begin{array}{rr} 2 \amp 1 \\ 0 \amp 2

      <p> Let's consider an example that illustrates how we can put
      these ideas to use. </p>

      <p> Suppose that we work for a car rental company that has two
      locations, <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.  When a customer rents a car
      at one location, they have the option to return it to either
      location at the end of the day.  After doing some market
      research, we determine:
      <ul>
	<li><p> 80% of the cars rented at location <m>P</m> are
	returned to <m>P</m> and 20% are returned to
	<m>Q</m>. </p></li> 

	<li><p> 40% of the cars rented at location <m>Q</m> are
	returned to <m>Q</m> and 60% are returned to
	<m>P</m>. </p></li>
      </ul>

      <ol marker="a.">

      <solution>
	<p> The solution to this activity is given in the text
	below. </p> 
      </solution>
    </activity>

    <p> This activity is important and motivates much of our work with
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors so it's worth reviewing
    to make sure we have a clear understanding of the concepts.
    </p>

    <p> First, we compute
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      A\vvec_1 =
      \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      0.8 \amp 0.6 \\
      0.2 \amp 0.4 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      \twovec{3}{1}
      \amp {}={}
      \twovec{3}{1}
      = 1\vvec_1
      \\
      \\
      A\vvec_2 =
      \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      0.8 \amp 0.6 \\
      0.2 \amp 0.4 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      \twovec{-1}{1}
      \amp {}={}
      \twovec{-0.2}{0.2}
      = 0.2\vvec_2\text{.} \\
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    This shows that <m>\vvec_1</m> is an eigenvector of <m>A</m> with
    eigenvalue <m>\lambda_1 = 1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m> is an
    eigenvector of <m>A</m> with eigenvalue <m>\lambda_2=0.2</m>.
    </p>

    <p> By the linearity of matrix matrix multiplication, we have
    <me>
      A(c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2) = c_1\vvec_1 + 0.2c_2\vvec_2
    </me>.
    Therefore, we will write the vector describing the initial
    distribution of cars 
    <m>\xvec_0=\ctwovec{1000}{0}</m> as a linear combination of
    <m>\vvec_1</m> and <m>\vvec_2</m>;  that is, <m>\xvec_0 =
    c_1\vvec_2 + c_2 \vvec_2</m>.  To do, we form the augmented matrix
    and row reduce:
    <me>
      \left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
      \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \xvec_0
      \end{array}\right]
      =
      \left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
      3 \amp -1 \amp 1000 \\
      1 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      \sim
      \left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
      1 \amp 0 \amp 250 \\
      0 \amp 1 \amp -250 \\
      \end{array}\right]
    </me>.
    Therefore, <m>\xvec_0 = 250\vvec_1 -250\vvec_2</m>.
    </p>

    <p> To determine the distribution of cars on subsequent days, we
    will repeatedly multiply by <m>A</m>.  We find that
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      \xvec_1 = A\xvec_0 \amp {}={}
      A(250\vvec_1 - 250\vvec_2) = 250\vvec_1 - (0.2)250\vvec_2 \\
      \xvec_2 = A\xvec_1 \amp {}={}
      A(250\vvec_1 - (0.2)250\vvec_2) = 250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^2250\vvec_2 \\
      \xvec_3 = A\xvec_2 \amp {}={}
      A(250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^2250\vvec_2) = 250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^3250\vvec_2 \\
      \xvec_4 = A\xvec_3 \amp {}={}
      A(250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^3250\vvec_2) = 250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^4250\vvec_2 \\
      \xvec_5 = A\xvec_4 \amp {}={}
      A(250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^4250\vvec_2) = 250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^5250\vvec_2 \\
      \end{aligned}
    </me>.
    </p>

    <p> In particular, this shows us that
    <me>
      \xvec_5 = 250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^5250\vvec_2 =
      \twovec{250\cdot 3 - (0.2)^5250\cdot(-1)}
      {250\cdot 1 - (0.2)^5250\cdot 1}
      = \twovec{750.09}{249.92}
    </me>.
    Taking notice of the pattern, we may write
    <me>
      \xvec_k = 250\vvec_1 - (0.2)^k250\vvec_2
    </me>.
    Multiplying a number by <m>0.2</m> is the same as taking 20% of
    that number.  As each day goes by, the second term is multiplied
    by <m>0.2</m> so the coefficient of <m>\vvec_2</m> in the
    expression for <m>\xvec_k</m> will eventually become extremely
    small.  We therefore see that the distribution of cars will 
    stabilize at <m>\xvec=250\vvec_1=\twovec{750}{250}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice how our understanding of the eigenvectors of the matrix
      allows us to replace matrix multiplication with the simpler
      operation of scalar multiplication.  As a result, we can look
      far into the future without having to repeatedly perform matrix
      multiplication.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, notice how this example relies on the fact that we
      can express the initial vector <m>\xvec_0</m> as a linear
      combination of eigenvectors.  For this reason, we would like,
      when given an <m>n\times n</m> matrix, to be able to create a
      basis of <m>\real^n</m> that consists of its eigenvectors.  We
      will frequently return to this question in later sections.
    </p>

      <statement>

  <subsection>
    <title> Summary </title>

    <p> We defined an eigenvector of a square matrix <m>A</m> to be a
    nonzero vector <m>\vvec</m> such that <m>A\vvec = \lambda\vvec</m>
    for some scalar <m>\lambda</m>, which is called the eigenvalue
    associated to <m>\vvec</m>.
    <ul>
      <li><p> If <m>\vvec</m> is an eigenvector, then matrix
      multiplication by <m>A</m> reduces to the simpler operation of
      scalar multiplication by <m>\lambda</m>. </p></li>

      <li><p> Scalar multiples of an eigenvector are also
      eigenvectors.  In fact, we will see that the eigenvectors
      associated to an eigenvalue <m>\lambda</m> form a
      subspace. </p></li>

      <li><p> If we can form a basis for <m>\real^n</m> consisting of
      eigenvectors of <m>A</m>, then <m>A</m> is, in some sense,
      equivalent to a diagonal matrix. </p></li>

      <li><p> Rewriting a vector <m>\xvec</m> as a linear combination
      of eigenvectors of <m>A</m> simplifies the process of repeatedly
      multiplying <m>\xvec</m> by <m>A</m>. </p></li>
