  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p> We saw a couple of model Internets in which a Markov chain
      defined by the Google matrix <m>G</m> did not converge to an
      appropriate PageRank vector.  For this reason, Google defines
      the matrix 
      <me>
	H_n = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	\frac1n \amp \frac1n \amp \ldots \amp \frac1n \\
	\frac1n \amp \frac1n \amp \ldots \amp \frac1n \\
	\vdots \amp \vdots \amp \ddots \amp \vdots \\
	\frac1n \amp \frac1n \amp \ldots \amp \frac1n \\
	\end{array}\right]
      </me>,
      where <m>n</m> is the number of web pages, and constructs a
      Markov chain from the modified 
      Google matrix 
      <me>G' = \alpha G + (1-\alpha)H_n</me>.
      Since <m>G'</m> is positive, the Markov chain is guaranteed to
      converge to a unique steady-state vector. </p>

      <p> We said that Google chooses <m>\alpha = 0.85</m> so we might
      wonder why this is a good choice.  We will explore the role of 
      <m>\alpha</m> in this exercise.  Let's consider the model
      Internet described in <xref 
      ref="fig-google-cyclic" /> and construct the Google matrix
      <m>G</m>.  In the Sage cell below, you can enter the matrix
      <m>G</m> and choose a value for <m>\alpha</m>.

      <p> This experiment gives some insight into the choice of
      <m>\alpha</m>.  The smaller <m>\alpha</m> is, the faster the

      <m>G'</m> that Google works with is so large, we would like to
      minimize the number of terms in the Markov chain that we need to
      compute.  On the other hand, as we lower <m>\alpha</m>, the
      matrix <m>G' = \alpha G + (1-\alpha)H_n</m> begins to resemble
      <m>H_n</m> more and <m>G</m> less.  The value
      <m>\alpha=0.85</m> is chosen so that the matrix <m>G'</m> sufficiently
      resembles <m>G</m> while having the Markov chain converge in a
      reasonable amount of steps.</p>
    </statement>
