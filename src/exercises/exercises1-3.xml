    <p> Shown below are some traffic patterns in the downtown area of
    a large city.  The figures give the number of cars per hour
    traveling along each road.  Any car that drives into an
    intersection must also leave the intersection.  This means that
    the number of cars entering an intersection in an hour is equal to
    the number of cars leaving the intersection.

		By studying the other three intersections, we form a

	  Let's now look at another traffic pattern.

		This shows that there are infinitely many solutions.
		This makes sense since the unknown flows <m>x</m>,

		Since we must have <m>y\geq 0</m>, it follows that the

      A typical problem in thermodynamics is to find the steady-state

      temperature around the boundary.  Let <m>T_1, T_2, \ldots,
      T_6</m> be the temperatures at the six nodes inside the
      plate as shown below.

            The temperature distribution of a thin plate.

          <description>
            <p>This diagram shows a rectangle that represents a thin
            two-dimensional plate.  There are three equally spaced
            vertical lines extending through the plate and two equally
            spaced horizontal lines.  The temperature at locations
            where the horizontal and vertical lines intersect the
            rectangle are described as follows.</p>
            <p>Along the top of the rectangle, the three temperatures
            are <m>15</m>, <m>20</m>, and <m>25</m>, reading from left
            to right.  Along the bottom, the temperatures are
            <m>10</m>, <m>20</m>, and <m>30</m>.</p>
            <p>The temperatures on the left side are both <m>10</m>,
            while the temperatures on the right side are <m>30</m> and
            <m>40</m>, reading from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>There are six points inside the rectangle where the
            horizontal and vertical lines intersect.  Reading from
            left to right and then top to bottom, the temperatures at
            these locations is denoted by <m>T_1</m>, <m>T_2</m> and
            so on to <m>T_6</m>.

          </description>

      </sidebyside>
      The temperature at a node is approximately the
      average of the four nearest nodes: for instance,
      <me>
	T_1 = (10 + 15 + T_2 + T_4)/4
      </me>,
      which we may rewrite as
      <me> 4T_1 - T_2 - T_4
      = 25
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Set up a linear system to find the temperature
      at these six points inside the plate.  Then use Sage to solve
      the linear system.  If all the entries of the matrix are
      integers, Sage will compute the reduced row echelon form using
      rational numbers.  To view a decimal approximation of the
      results, you may use

      In the real world, the approximation becomes better as we add

		When we create the augmented matrix and find its

		We need all the quantities to be integers, and the

	    Solving this linear system, we find

	    Once again, we choose <m>x_6</m> to be the smallest

	    This gives the reaction:

  <statement>
    <p> We began this section by stating that increasing
    computational power has helped linear algebra assume a 
    prominent role as a scientific tool.  Later, we looked at one
    computational limitation:  once a matrix gets to be too big,
    it is not reasonable to apply Gaussian elimination
    to find its reduced row echelon form. </p>

    <p> In this exercise, we will see another limitation:
    computer arithmetic with real numbers is only an
    approximation because computers represent real numbers
    with only a finite number of bits.  For instance, the number
    pi
    <me>
      \pi =
      3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399\ldots
    </me>
    would be approximated inside a computer by, say,
    <me>
      \pi\approx 3.141592653589793
    </me>
    Most of the time, this is not a problem.  However,
    when we perform millions or even billions of arithmetic
    operations, the error in these approximations starts to
    accumulate and can lead to results that are wildly
    inaccurate.  Here are two examples demonstrating this.

    <ol marker="a.">
      <li> <p>
	Let's first see an example showing that computer
	arithmetic really is an approximation.  First, consider
	the linear system
	<me>
	  \begin{alignedat}{4}
	  x \amp {}+{} \amp \frac12y \amp {}+{} \amp \frac13z \amp
	  {}={} \amp 1 \\
	  \frac12x \amp {}+{} \amp \frac13y \amp {}+{} \amp \frac14z \amp
	  {}={} \amp 0 \\
	  \frac13x \amp {}+{} \amp \frac14y \amp {}+{} \amp \frac15z \amp
	  {}={} \amp 0 \\
	  \end{alignedat}
	</me>
	If the coefficients are entered into Sage as fractions,
	Sage will find the exact reduced row echelon form.  Find
	the exact solution to this linear system.
	<sage>
	  <input>
	  </input>
	</sage>
      </p>

      <p>
	Now let's ask Sage to compute with real numbers.  We can
	do this by representing one of the coefficients as a
	decimal.  For instance, the same linear system can be
	represented as 
	<me>
	  \begin{alignedat}{4}
	  x \amp {}+{} \amp 0.5y \amp {}+{} \amp \frac13z \amp
	  {}={} \amp 1 \\
	  \frac12x \amp {}+{} \amp \frac13y \amp {}+{} \amp \frac14z \amp
	  {}={} \amp 0 \\
	  \frac13x \amp {}+{} \amp \frac14y \amp {}+{} \amp \frac15z \amp
	  {}={} \amp 0 \\
	  \end{alignedat}
	</me>
	Most computers do arithmetic using either 32 or 64 bits.  To
	magnify the problem so that we can see it better, we
	will ask Sage to do arithmetic using only 10 bits as follows.
	<sage>
	  <input>
	    R = RealNumber
	    RealNumber = RealField(10)
	    
	    # enter the matrix below
	    A = matrix( ..., ..., [ ... ] )

	    print (A.rref())
	    RealNumber = R
	  </input>
	</sage>
	What does Sage give for the solution now?  Compare this to
	the exact solution that you found previously.
      </p></li>

      <li> <p>
	Some types of linear systems are particularly sensitive to
	errors resulting from computers' approximate arithmetic.
	For instance, suppose we are interested in the linear system
	<me>
	  \begin{alignedat}{3}
	  x \amp {}+{} \amp y \amp {}={} \amp 2 \\
	  x \amp {}+{} 1.001\amp y \amp {}={} \amp 2 \\
	  \end{alignedat}
	</me>
	Find the solution to this linear system.
	<sage>
	  <input>
	  </input>
	</sage>
      </p>

      <p>
	Suppose now that the computer has accumulated some error
	in one of the entries of this system so that it incorrectly
	stores the system as
	<me>
	  \begin{alignedat}{3}
	  x \amp {}+{} \amp y \amp {}={} \amp 2 \\
	  x \amp {}+{} 1.001\amp y \amp {}={} \amp 2.001 \\
	  \end{alignedat}
	</me>
	Find the solution to this linear system.
	<sage>
	  <input>
	  </input>
	</sage>
      </p>

      <p> Notice how a small error in one of the entries in the
      linear system leads to a solution that has a dramatically
      large error.  Fortunately, this is an issue that has been
      well studied, and there are techniques that mitigate
      this type of behavior.
