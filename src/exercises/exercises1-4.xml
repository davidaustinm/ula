      <p> For each of the augmented matrices in reduced row echelon
      form given below, determine whether the corresponding linear
      system is consistent and, if so, determine whether the
      solution is unique.  If the system is consistent, identify the
      free variables and the basic variables and give a description of
      the solution space in parametric form.

	We began our explorations in <xref ref="sec-expect" /> by

	<ol marker="a.">
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Remember that the solution space of a single linear
	      equation in three variables is a plane.  Can two planes
	      ever intersect in a single point?  What are the possible
	      ways in which two planes can intersect?  How can our
	      understanding of pivot positions help answer these
	      questions?
