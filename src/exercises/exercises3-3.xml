    <statement>
      <p> There are several steps to the JPEG compression algorithm.
      The following questions examine the motivation behind some of
      them. 
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> What is the overall goal of the JPEG compression
	algorithm? 
	</p></li>
	
	<li><p> Why do we convert colors from the the <m>RGB</m> color
	model to the <m>YC_bC_r</m> model? </p></li>

	<li><p> Why do we decompose the image into a collection of
	<m>8\times8</m> arrays of pixels? </p></li>

	<li><p> What role does the Discrete Fourier Transform play in
	the JPEG compression algorithm? </p></li>

	<li><p> Why is the information conveyed by the rapid-variation
	Fourier coefficients, generally speaking, less important than
	the slow-variation coefficients?
	</p></li>
      </ol></p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p><ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> The goal is to represent the image in a format that
	requires less storage but still allows us to reconstruct the
	image with most of the visual information preserved.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> In the <m>YC_bC_r</m> color model, the most significant
	visual information is stored in the <m>Y</m> channel.
	Therefore, we should store most of this information.  The
	information in the <m>C_b</m> and <m>C_r</m> channels is not
	as visually significant so we can store a smaller amount of
	that data without noticing the effect.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> As seen in an image, these blocks are relatively
	small, which means that the approximations we reconstruct are
	probably not noticeably different from the original.  Also,
	the blocks are small enough so that the image does not
	typically change a lot over the block.  At the same time, the
	blocks are large enough to allow us to save storage by
	throwing away some of the Fourier coefficients.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> The Discrete Fourier Transform represents the data in
	a block as its average and variations from the average.
	Since the blocks are relatively small, there will typically be
	small variations away from the average.  Therefore, we can
	often ignore those variations without visually
	detecting the approximation.  </p></li>

	<li><p> Our eyes do not detect individual pixels so we do not
	detect differences from one pixel to the next.  This means that
	we do not typically notice rapid variations.

      <m>YC_bC_r</m> color models.  In this exercise, we will look at
      the <m>HSV</m> color model where <m>H</m> is the hue, <m>S</m>
      is the saturation, and <m>V</m> is the value of the color.  All

      <p> The <m>YC_bC_r</m> color model concentrates the most
      important visual information in the luminance coordinate, which
      roughly measures the brightness of the color.  The other two
      coordinates describe the hue of the color.  By contrast, the
      <m>HSV</m> color model concentrates all the information about
      the hue in the <m>H</m> coordinate.
      </p>

      <p> This is useful in computer vision applications.  For
      instance, if we want a robot to detect a blue ball in its field
      of vision, we can specify a range of hue values to search for.
      If the lighting changes in the room, the saturation and value
      may change, but the hue will not.  This increases the likelihood
      that the robot will still detect the blue ball across a wide
      range of lighting conditions.
