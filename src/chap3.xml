  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="chap2" />, we examined the
      <xref ref="fundamental-questions" text="custom">
	two fundamental	questions
      </xref>
      concerning the existence and uniqueness of solutions to linear
      systems independently of one another.  We found that every
      equation of the form <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> has a solution when
      the span of the columns of <m>A</m> is <m>\real^m</m>.  We
      also found that the solution <m>\xvec=\zerovec</m> of the
      homogeneous equation <m>A\xvec = \zerovec</m> is unique when the
      columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.  In this chapter,
      we explore the situation in which these two conditions hold
      simultaneously.
