    "# Tutorial: Sage and Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "When studying linear algebra, it's vitally important that you learn to use a computer to perform important algebraic operations.  The reason linear algebra is an increasingly important mathematical tool is because computers faciliate computations that are not accessible without them.  In particular, typical applications may work with $10,000\\times10,000$ matrices, and there's no way to do that without a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our class, most of the computations will be performed in Sage, which is a software environment that is designed for learning mathematics.  You don't need to know this, but Sage is built in Python so some of our Sage commands will look familiar if you know Python (but it's ok if you don't!).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to access Sage.  For one, I'll show you how you can do some simple computations within a web page.  You can also create Sage notebooks within cocalc, and you can install Sage for free on your own laptop though you don't certainly need to do that.  However, one way to access Sage is through a Jupyter notebook, like the one you're reading now.  The advantage to this format is that I can share notebooks with you that contain explanatory text (like you're reading) and specialized commands to automate some of what we're learning and that allow you to import data sets to investigate.  In addition, you can save your work and come back to it at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a Jupyter notebook, Sage computations are performed in \"cells\" like the one below.  To evaluate this cell, click in it and press Shift-Enter.  The result of evaluating this cell will appear below."

A frequently-studied data set consists of the measurements of 150 irises and can be [found here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).  For each of the 150 irises, four measurements are given in centimeters.  The cell below will pull in the data set, create a vector for each of the 150 flowers using two of the measurements, and then plot them.  You do not need to worry about how this code works.
